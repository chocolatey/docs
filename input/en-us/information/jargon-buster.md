Title: Jargon Buster
Description: A reference guide on the jargon and acronyms used in our documentation
---

While a goal for our documentation is clarity we recognize that as engineers and technical users of our software, we speak and write in a manner that may not always be as clear to others as we would like.

One of our goals for writing documentation, is clarity. As we update our documentation we strive to bring clarity to it. But this is a work in-progress. We recognize that jargon and acronyms can cause confusion, misunderstanding and act as a barrier for those who are getting started with our software.

This guide aims to define the common jargon and acronyms used in our documentation. It contains both Chocolatey specific, and more general computer jargon and acronyms.

If you feel a definition is missing, unclear or could be better, please raise an issue on our [Documentation GitHub repository](https://github.com/chocolatey/docs).
