## Options and Switches

> :memo: **NOTE** Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are
 running a command like install that allows installing multiple
 packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, it is going to look for and
 try to install version 1.0.0 of every package passed. So please split
 out multiple package calls when wanting to pass specific options.

Includes [default options/switches](xref:choco-commands#default-options-and-switches) (included below for completeness).
