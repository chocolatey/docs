## What is Chocolatey?

Chocolatey is a software management solution that allows you to manage 100% of your software, anywhere you have Windows, with any endpoint management tool. No other solution (including newly announced solutions) reach this level of management - most only can manage to software in Programs and Features.

Chocolatey is a software management solution unlike anything else you've ever experienced on Windows. It focuses on simplicity, security, and infinite scalability. You write a software deployment in PowerShell once for any software (not just installers), then you can deploy it everywhere you have Windows with any solution that can manage systems (configuration management, endpoint management, etc) and track and manage updates of that software over time. Manage software on-premise, in the "Cloud", or in [Docker containers](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-agent-docker/blob/f870fbf259a803c6a6d902e1c01f631936069d66/windows/servercore/10.0.14393/standard/VS2017/Dockerfile) with Chocolatey.

Whew, that was a mouthful! For a bit more detail into what all of that means and more, see [What is Chocolatey?](xref:getting-started#what-is-chocolatey)
