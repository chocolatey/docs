Title: CPMR0056 - Invalid URL (nuspec)
Description: Information on how to remediate the Chocolatey Package Moderation Rule 0056
RuleType: Guideline
---

<?! Include "../../../../../shared/package-validator-rule-guideline.txt" /?>

## Issue

In the nuspec, one of the URLs provided is invalid. Usually this means that the URL does not actually go to a website.

The following URL's, if invalid, will be marked as a Guideline (would be good if it could be fixed).

* description - Guideline
* releaseNotes - Guideline

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> Within the Description and ReleaseNotes elements, all URL's contained within them will be validated.

## Recommended Solution

Please update the incorrect field(s) so that it results in a valid URL.

## Reasoning

We expect that the URLs actually go to an existing URL

## Troubleshooting

We have worked through a number of issues where valid URL were actually being flagged as invalid.  If you believe that a valid URL within your nuspec file is being flagged as invalid, please reply on the package moderation page, and a moderator can help investigate.
