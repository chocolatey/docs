## Issue

In automation scripts (`.ps1`/`.psm1`), the package has used a chocolatey command that should not be used. Rather a dependency should be taken on a package.

 * cinst
 * choco install
 * choco upgrade

> :choco-info: **NOTE**

> The search can also hit a false positive if it finds any of the above words in the package's automation scripts.

## Recommended Solution

Please add dependencies to the nuspec.

## Reasoning

Calling Chocolatey commands when running Chocolatey is considered an anti-pattern, and it hides dependency required for other packages, which should be expressed.
