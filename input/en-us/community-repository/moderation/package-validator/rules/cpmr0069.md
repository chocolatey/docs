Title: CPMR0069 - Package Id is too long, and doesn't contain dashes (nuspec)

## Issue

The package id is longer than 20 characters but does not include dashes (`-`) to break up the words to make it readable.

## Recommended Solution

If this is a new package that has never been approved, moderators will review and reject the package for one that will be pushed with a new id that meets the [package naming guidelines](xref:create-packages#naming-your-package).

If this is an already existing package, there is really nothing you can do at this time aside from deprecate the current package in favor of a newly created one. Please see [deprecating a package](xref:deprecate-a-package)

## Reasoning

A name for a package id should be easily understandable. When it becomes really long with no breaks, it makes it hard to understand on first view where each word is. Consider that when folks see a package id, it will be in lowercase, e.g. `this-package-id` is easier to digest than `thispackageid`.
