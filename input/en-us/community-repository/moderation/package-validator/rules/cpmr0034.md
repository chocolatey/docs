## Issue

In an automation script (`.ps1`/`.psm1`), the use of sourceforge was found for downloading software. It is not recommended to use SourceForge if an alternative, official distribution location is available. Unfortunately, some software is only available on SourceForge so this is a Guideline and not a Requirement.

## Recommended Solution

Please find another official distribution point to download from if there is one.

## Reasoning

We've found that SourceForge has had some practices in recent times that are at odds with how we want to get software installed (malware free). Usually when installing silently, software doesn't also try to install crapware on a machine. This is not always so with the sourceforge wrapper that comes along with some of these downloads.
