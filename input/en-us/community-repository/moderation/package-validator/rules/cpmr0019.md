Title: CPMR0019 - Nuspec Contains Templated Values (nuspec)
Description: Information on how to remediate the Chocolatey Package Moderation Rule 0019
RuleType: Requirement

<?! Include "../../../../../shared/package-validator-rule-requirement.txt" /?>

## Issue

In the nuspec, templates values that were added by Chocolatey CLI have been left in the file. These values are not considered to be valid information, and only a placeholder for what users can make use of.

## Recommended Solution

Any templated values given by Chocolatey CLI should be replaced with an appropriate value for the Software the Package is responsible for, or removed if no proper information is available.

## Reasoning

As these are informations given to users, having such invalid placeholders in the nuspec file only serves to confuse users and cause packages to be considered of bad quality.
