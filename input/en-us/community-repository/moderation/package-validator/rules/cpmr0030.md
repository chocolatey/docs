RuleType: Requirement

## Issue

The Description element of the package nuspec file contains invalid Markdown headings.  For example, you may have this:

```
###This is my heading
```
instead of:

```
### This is my heading
```

## Recommended Solution

Please update the description element of the nuspec file to contain valid Markdown Headings.  More information can be found [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#headers).

## Reasoning

The Chocolatey Community Repository uses the Markdig Library for parsing/rendering Markdown content.  When invalid headings are used, the result looks like the following:

A prior version of the Chocolatey Community Repository did support this way for writing headings, but it is not part of the official Markdown specification, and as such, we don't want any further invalid headings making their way into the repository.
