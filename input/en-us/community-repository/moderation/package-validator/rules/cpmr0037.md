## Issue

In automation scripts (`.ps1`/`.psm1`), the package has used one of the below items without also including a `chocolateyUninstall.ps1` to remove any thing changed by those items.

 * Install-ChocolateyPath
 * Install-ChocolateyEnvironmentVariable
 * Install-ChocolateyExplorerMenuItem
 * Install-ChocolateyShortcut
 * Install-ChocolateyFileAssociation
 * Install-BinFile / Generate-BinFile / Add-BinFile

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> The search can also hit a false positive if it finds any of the above words in the package's automation scripts.

## Recommended Solution

Please add a `chocolateyUninstall.ps1` and reverse any install actions in the uninstall.

## Reasoning

The above items put the computer/machine they are installing to in a certain state. When the package is removed or uninstalled, the underlying changes to the machine should go away as well.
