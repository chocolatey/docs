## Issue

In an automation script (`.ps1`/`.psm1`), you used `Win32_Product`. This can cause serious performance issues and have an adverse affect on Windows.

## Recommended Solution

Instead do a registry search under Uninstaller to see if the application is installed.

## Reasoning

"Win32_Product" forces Windows Installer to reconfigure every application installed through MSI (see Windows event log). Depending on installed applications it may take more than 30 minutes to execute a request.
