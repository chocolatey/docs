## Issue

The package id includes dots and has not been found to be an `*.install`/`*.portable` package.

## Recommended Solution

If this is a new package that has never been approved, moderators will review and reject the package for one that will be pushed with a new id that meets the [package naming guidelines](xref:create-packages#naming-your-package).

If this is an already existing package, there is really nothing you can do at this time aside from deprecate the current package in favor of a newly created one. Please see [deprecating a package](xref:deprecate-a-package)

## Reasoning

Naming should be consistent for packages on the community feed so it's easy to understand.
