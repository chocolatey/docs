Title: CPMR0001 - Copyright Character Count Below 4 (nuspec)
Description: Information on how to remediate the Chocolatey Package Moderation Rule 0001
RuleType: Requirement

<?! Include "../../../../../shared/package-validator-rule-requirement.txt" /?>

## Issue

In the nuspec, there is a `<copyright>` field. Usually a copyright contains year (or range of years) and a company. Since a year takes up four characters by itself, the validator has detected that you are not using the copyright field correctly.

## Recommended Solution

Please update the copyright field so that it is using at least 4 characters.

## Reasoning

Usually the year alone takes up four characters, so properly setting a copyright would include years and name of company.
