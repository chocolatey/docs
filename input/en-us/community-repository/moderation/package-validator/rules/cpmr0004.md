## Issue

You have repackaged an existing package that you unpacked without removing some of the packaging files from the original.

## Recommended Solution

Please remove the following files:

* [Content_Types].xml
* Files ending in .psmdcp
* Files ending .rels
* _rels directory and its contents

## Reasoning

The package will have issues if these are included again.
