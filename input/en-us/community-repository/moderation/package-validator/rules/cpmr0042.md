Title: CPMR0042 - ReleaseNotes Missing (nuspec)

## Issue

In the nuspec, there is a `<releaseNotes />` element. It was found to be missing or empty in the package.

## Recommended Solution

Please update the nuspec to include a `<releaseNotes />` element that is non-empty. If your nuspec file is missing this field, you should run `choco new testpkg` and look at the output from that as a comparison to your current package (ensure you have the [latest version of Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages?q=id%3Achocolatey)).

## Reasoning

The release notes field gives folks a way of knowing what has changed between versions of the software (and sometimes related to packaging changes).
