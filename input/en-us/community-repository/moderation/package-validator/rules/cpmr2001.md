Title: CPMR2001 - Nuspec Enhancements Missing (nuspec)
Description: Information on how to remediate the Chocolatey Package Moderation Rule 2001
RuleType: Suggestion
---

## Issue

The nuspec is missing the recent enhancements that give consumers information related to the underlying software.

## Recommended Solution

Please update the nuspec to contain one or more of the following:

  * `docsUrl` - points to the location of the wiki or docs of the software
  * `mailingListUrl` - points to the forum or email list group for the software
  * `bugTrackerUrl` - points to the location where issues and tickets can be accessed
  * `packageSourceUrl` - points to the location of your chocolatey package files in source (e.g. `https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-coreteampackages`)
  * `projectSourceUrl` - points to the location of the underlying software source

> :memo: **NOTE** You must use `choco pack` with at least version [0.9.9.7](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0997-june-20-2015) (see [#205](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/205)) to use these elements. Using NuGet or `nuget.exe` will error on this element.

> :memo: **NOTE** If your nuspec file is missing these fields, you should run `choco new testpkg` and look at the output from that (ensure you have the [latest version of Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages?q=id%3Achocolatey)).

## Reasoning

This provides folks with more information related to the software itself and gives folks a quick location reference to start from when attempting to find more information related to a project.
