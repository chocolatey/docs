Title: CPMR0006 - VERIFICATION.txt file missing when binaries included (package)
Description: Information on how to remediate the Chocolatey Package Moderation Rule 0006
RuleType: Requirement

<?! Include "../../../../../shared/package-validator-rule-requirement.txt" /?>

## Issue

In the package, you have included binaries but have not given moderators and the community a way to verify the files are legitimate.

## Recommended Solution

Please add a file named VERIFICATION.txt. You can see the format for that file if you call `choco new test` (upgrade to the latest version of Chocolatey first) and look at the generated file in `test\tools\VERIFICATION.txt`

This check also looks for `VERIFICATION` and `VERIFICATION.md`. Casing doesn't matter for validation.

**NOTE:** Providing checksums in verification is helpful, but OPTIONAL. The package already captures the checksums for binaries and displays that on the package page, so a user can use VERIFICATION to download the actual and verify it against the items listed in the files section of the package page.

### Software Author / Vendor Specific

Software authors and vendors maintaining their own Chocolatey packages must also provide a verification file as outlined above.
The built-in templates from Chocolatey CLI may include outdated information on this and will be updated in a future release.

## Reasoning

If you include binaries in the package, even if you are the software vendor, you need to include a VERIFICATION.txt file. This allows moderators and the community build trust in using the package. A verification file tells folks how to verify the files are legitimate, whether specific instructions on verification with the official location, or with a notice that you are the software vendor.
