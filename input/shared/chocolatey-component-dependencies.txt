## Chocolatey Component Package Dependencies

Some of the Chocolatey component packages have dependencies on other Chocolatey components.
The following table aims to illustrate those dependencies, based on the latest shipped version of each component.

| Package Name / Dependency      | chocolatey  | chocolatey.extension | chocolateygui |
|------------------------------- |-------------|----------------------|---------------|
| chocolatey v1.1.0              |             |                      |               |
| chocolatey.extension v4.1.0    | v1.0.0      |                      |               |
| chocolatey-agent v1.0.0        |             | v4.0.0               |               |
| chocolateygui v1.0.0           | v1.0.0      |                      |               |
| chocolateygui.extension v1.0.0 |             | v4.0.0               | v1.0.0        |

> :warning: **WARNING**
>
> Due the nature of how Chocolatey package dependencies work, we can ensure that all the required package versions are
> installed. For example, if you were to install chocolateygui.extension then it would make sure that the following tree
> of packages, with as a minimum these package versions, are installed:
>
> | Package Name            | Version |
> | ----------------------- | ------- |
> | chocolateygui.extension | v1.0.0  |
> | chocolateygui           | v1.0.0  |
> | chocolatey.extension    | v4.0.0  |
> | chocolatey              | v1.0.0  |
>
> :memo: **NOTE**
>
> Newer package versions may be available at the time of installation, and Chocolatey will pick the highest
> available that matches the defined dependency range.
>
> However, there is nothing that can be done to ensure that indirect dependencies are satisfied.
> For example, if you currently have chocolateygui v0.18.1 installed along with chocolateygui.extension
>  v0.2.1 and you first upgrade to chocolateygui v0.19.0, then you will see errors if you attempt to
> run Chocolatey GUI, since the chocolateygui.extension package also needs to be updated.
>
> Based on the package releases, the recommended installation/upgrade order is the following:
>
> * chocolateygui.extension
> * chocolateygui
> * chocolatey-agent
> * chocolatey.extension
> * chocolatey
>
> This will ensure that all dependencies, both direct and indirect, are installed.
