<Callout type="warning">
    It is not possible to use both the <Xref title="HideAllRemoteChocolateySources" value="hide-all-remote-chocolatey-sources" /> and the <Xref title="HideThisPCSource" value="hide-this-pc-source" /> features at the same time.
    Doing this would effectively mean that there is nothing to display within the Chocolatey GUI Application.
    If both of these features are enabled at the same time, the HideAllRemoteChocolateySources feature takes precedence and only the This PC source will be displayed.
