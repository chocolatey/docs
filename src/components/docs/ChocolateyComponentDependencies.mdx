## Chocolatey Component Package Dependencies

Some of the Chocolatey component packages have dependencies on other Chocolatey components.
The following table aims to illustrate those dependencies, based on the latest shipped version of each component.
Please refer to our <Xref title="Support Lifecycle information" value="chocolatey-components-dependencies-and-support-lifecycle" anchor="product-support-lifecycle" /> for details on which versions are supported for licensed and open source customers.

| chocolatey.extension v6.3.0    | v2.0.0      |                      |               |
| chocolatey-agent v2.2.1        |             | v6.0.0               |               |
| chocolateygui v2.1.1           | v2.0.0      |                      |               |
| chocolateygui.extension v2.0.0 |             | v6.0.0               | v2.0.0        |
| chocolatey v1.4.1              |             |                      |               |
| chocolatey.extension v5.0.6    | v1.2.0      |                      |               |
| chocolatey-agent v1.1.4        |             | v4.0.0               |               |
| chocolateygui v1.1.3           | v1.0.0      |                      |               |

<Callout type="warning">
    Due to the nature of how Chocolatey package dependencies work, we can ensure that all the required package versions are
    installed. For example, if you were to install chocolateygui.extension then it would make sure that the following tree
    of packages, with as a minimum these package versions, are installed:
    
    | Package Name            | Version |
    | ----------------------- | ------- |
    | chocolateygui.extension | v2.0.0  |
    | chocolateygui           | v2.0.0  |
    | chocolatey.extension    | v6.0.0  |
    | chocolatey              | v2.0.0  |
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
    Newer package versions may be available at the time of installation, and Chocolatey will pick the highest
    available that matches the defined dependency range.
    
    However, there is nothing that can be done to ensure that indirect dependencies are satisfied.
    For example, if you currently have chocolateygui v0.18.1 installed along with chocolateygui.extension
     v0.2.1 and you first upgrade to chocolateygui v0.19.0, then you will see errors if you attempt to
    run Chocolatey GUI, since the chocolateygui.extension package also needs to be updated.
    
    Based on the package releases, the recommended installation/upgrade order is the following:
    
    * chocolateygui.extension
    * chocolateygui
    * chocolatey-agent
    * chocolatey.extension
    * chocolatey
    
    This will ensure that all dependencies, both direct and indirect, are installed.
