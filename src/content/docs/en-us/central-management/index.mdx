### Chocolatey Central Management Component Compatibility Matrix

Chocolatey Central Management has specific needs that are mostly handled by packaging aspects. As the Chocolatey Agent and Chocolatey Central Management communicate with each other, there are some versions that may not be compatible with each other due to mistakes or fixes that needed to be implemented. This serves as a means of capturing that for you.

<Callout type="info">
    Central Management packages (all three) are treated as a singular unit, meaning that they all must be on the same version across one or more machines. Using different versions of Chocolatey Central Management packages is unsupported and will likely not work properly.

### If I update the license file, do I need to restart my services and web?

Yes, you do need to restart the agents, the service, and the web to pick up the license. Here's a handy script:

```powershell
Get-Service chocolatey-* | Stop-Service
Get-Process -Name "ChocolateySoftware.ChocolateyManagement.Web.Mvc" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process
Get-Service chocolatey-* | Start-Service
```

For your agent machines:

```powershell
Get-Service chocolatey-* | Stop-Service
Get-Service chocolatey-* | Start-Service
```

## Common Errors and Resolutions

### Computers checking in are overwriting each other

You are generating machines from a base image that already had Chocolatey commercial code on it. This is okay, but you need to remove the Chocolatey Machine Id Guid, which is used to identify a machine as unique.

When the licensed agent service is installed on a machine, a unique machine id is given to the machine. If you are starting from a template, there is no opportunity for that to be different and when those machines start checking in, they will start overwriting each other.

Basically you need to go find the machine id at `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Chocolatey\` (`UniqueId`) and remove it as part of your image deployment mechanism.

```powershell
Write-Host "Removing Chocolatey Unique Machine GUID"
Remove-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\Software\Chocolatey" -Name "UniqueId" -Force
# Restart the Agent Service if it is running
```

Once you've removed this, you'll need to restart the Agent Service to get it regenerated.

<Callout type="info">
    You may **also** need to remove the ChocolateyLocalAdmin user (if you are using it for services) and reinstall the Agent service (and CCM service if on this machine) to get that password corrected.
</Callout>

### An Internal error occurred during your request

Check the log files. You may have incorrect database access, but most likely it can come because you didn't follow the steps for setup appropriately.

### System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: Invalid column name

This means you are upgrading things out of order. Please make sure your database is upgraded first, then the service, then the web.
