    This feature is available in Chocolatey Central Management starting with version 0.12.0.
</Callout>

On the <Xref title="Chocolatey Central Management Dashboard" value="ccm-dashboard" /> there is a count of the `Total Stale Computers`. This is defined as `the total number of Computers that haven't reported into Chocolatey Central Management in the last 180 days.`.  Here 180 is the default value, but you can change this by using the following steps:

1. Open the Chocolatey Central Management Site in the browser.
1. Login with the `ccmadmin` user.
1. In the left-hand menu click on `Administration` and then `Settings`.
1. Click on the `Dashboard` tab in the `Settings` screen.

1. Click the `Save All` button to save changes.

<Callout type="info">
    When the <Xref title="Stale Computer Retention Policy" value="ccm-administration-settings-retention" anchor="stale-computer-retention" /> is enabled, it is not possible to set the `Amount of time, in Days, before being notified of Computers not reporting in` for the Dashboard to a number that is lower than what is currently configured for the `Amount of time, in Days, to keep stale Computers before deleting` setting, and vice versa.  If this is attempted, a validation warning will be shown.

<Callout type="info">
    When upgrading to Chocolatey Central Management 0.12.0, if the <Xref title="Stale Computer Retention Policy" value="ccm-administration-settings-retention" anchor="stale-computer-retention" /> is enabled, if the current value for `Amount of time, in Days, to keep stale Computers before deleting` is less than the default value for `Amount of time, in Days, before being notified of Computers not reporting in`, a change will be made to the default value to make it half of the configured value for `Amount of time, in Days, to keep stale Computers before deleting`.
