## Operation logs

The Chocolatey Central Management Website stores a lot of information about the operations that have been performed on it.

It is possible to search for operations that have happened using a number of different filters:

- Date range
- User name

Expanding the `Show advanced filters` section displays the following filters:

- Service
- Duration
- Action
- Error state
- Browser

Once the required filters have been set, pressing the `Refresh` button will show the available results.

It is possible to see all available information for an operation by clicking the 🔍 button to the left-hand side of the table.

If required, the available results can be exported to an Excel document using the `Export | Export to Excel` button.
This will generate a file named something similar to the following `Chocolatey_AuditLogs_20231122_095144.xlsx`.

The length of time that Operation logs are stored within the Chocolatey Central Management Website can be configured in the <Xref title="Retention Policies" value="ccm-administration-settings-retention" anchor="audit-retention" /> Settings tab.
