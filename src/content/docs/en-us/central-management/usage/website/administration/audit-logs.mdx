## Operation logs

The Chocolatey Central Management Website stores a lot of information about the operations that have been performed on it.

It is possible to search for operations that have happened using a number of different filters:

- Date range
- User name

Expanding the **Toggle advanced filters** section displays the following filters:

- Service
- Duration
- Action
- Error state
- Browser

Once the required filters have been set, pressing the **Apply filters** button will show the available results.

It is possible to see all available information for an operation by clicking the **Details** button in the **Quick Actions** column of the table.

If required, the available results can be exported to an Excel document using the **Actions for Audit Logs** button menu.
This will generate a file named something similar to the following `Chocolatey_AuditLogs_20231122_095144.xlsx`.

The length of time that Operation logs are stored within the Chocolatey Central Management Website can be configured in the <Xref title="Retention Policies" value="ccm-administration-settings-retention" anchor="audit-retention" /> Settings tab.
