The Chocolatey Central Management Site needs to be able to send email for certain actions.  For example, when a new user is registering with the system, or when sending out forgotten password emails.  Valid SMTP Configuration has to be provided in order for these emails to be sent out.  Follow these steps to configure SMTP for Chocolatey Central Management.

1. Open the Chocolatey Central Management Site in the browser.
1. Login with the `ccmadmin` user.
1. In the left sidebar menu click on **Administration** and then **Settings**.
1. Click on the **Email (SMTP)** tab in the **Settings** screen.

1. Add the SMTP settings for your environment.  If you uncheck the `Override default SMTP authentication` checkbox, you will need to provide the `Domain name`, `User name` and `SMTP Password` for a user that is permitted to send email via the system that is being used.
1. Click the **Save all** button to save changes.
1. Change the email address to go to your email address.
1. Click the **Send test email** button and ensure that an email is received correctly.
1. You should receive a green toast notification at the bottom right of the screen indicating success.

<Callout type="warning">
    If you leave either the `Default from (sender) email address` or `Default from (sender) display name` with their default values, you will see an error when an email is attempted to be sent via the system.
