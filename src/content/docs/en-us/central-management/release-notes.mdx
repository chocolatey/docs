  - Users who are not a member of the CCM Administrator role will only be shown a warning that the passphrase needs to be changed and to contact their Administrator to do so.

## 0.5.0 (March 25, 2021) \{#march-25-2021}

### Breaking Changes

- Deployments - Provide better resiliency when handling large numbers of computers within a Deployment Plan - see [Licensed #212](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-licensed-issues/issues/212)

Previously, while not recommended, the CCM Service could be run as a user with non-administrative rights on the machine, as long as certain permissions were provided to the user.  Going forward, there is now a strict requirement that the user that is running the CCM Service has administrative rights on the machine.  This is needed to ensure reliability of messages delivered into the CCM Service.
