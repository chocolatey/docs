## Upgrade Process

<Callout type="info">
    The upgrade of `chocolatey-agent` through `chocolatey-agent` will require a restart of the service in order for the new version to be picked up.
</Callout>

### Minor / Patch Versions (for example 1.1.x to 1.3.x, or 1.1.1 to 1.1.5)

To upgrade Chocolatey Agent directly, you can upgrade it through Chocolatey CLI with the command `choco upgrade chocolatey-agent`.

### Major Versions

When upgrading Chocolatey Agent to a new major version (for example, **v1.x** to **v2.x**) a specific upgrade process needs to be followed to ensure that all its dependencies will be correctly installed.

As an example, the upgrade process for v1.x to v2.x is as follows:

1. Ensure you are on the latest stable **v1.x** version of Chocolatey CLI, **v5.x** version of Chocolatey Licensed Extension, and **v1.x** version of Chocolatey Agent.
    - To find the latest versions, you can use `choco search --exact chocolatey --all-versions` (or `chocolatey.extension` / `chocolatey.agent` for those packages).
      You can also visit [Chocolatey CLI's Chocolatey Community Repository page](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey) (or other packages' pages on the site) and look at the Version History section to get this list.
1. Upgrade `chocolatey` **first**.
1. Due to the dependency version ranges and Chocolatey CLI's dependency resolution, `chocolatey-agent` will be upgraded alongside the `chocolatey` package and associated dependencies.

### Using Chocolatey Central Management to Upgrade chocolatey-agent

Because Chocolatey Central Management uses `chocolatey-agent` to perform its actions, the upgrade will require a restart of the service.
The easiest way to do this is with a scheduled task as part of an Advanced Deployment Step.

A recommended Advanced Deployment Step script to do this is as follows:

<Callout type="info">
    If upgrading `chocolatey-agent` to a new **major** version, target **only** the `chocolatey` package for the `choco upgrade` command in the script below, instead of the `chocolatey-agent` package.
</Callout>

```powershell
$delayInMinutes = 1

# If using an internal repository to install Chocolatey Agent, replace `chocolatey.licensed` below
# with the name or URL of your internally configured source.
choco upgrade chocolatey-agent --source 'chocolatey.licensed'

# Ensure the deployment task registers as failed if the installation failed, and skip registering the
# scheduled task.
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) {
    Write-Error 'The upgrade failed!'
    exit $LASTEXITCODE
}

# Restart the Agent service after the preset delay time via a scheduled task.
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Once -At (Get-Date).AddMinutes($delayInMinutes)
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute 'powershell.exe' -Argument "-WindowStyle Hidden -Command Restart-Service chocolatey-agent"
$principal = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -GroupId Administrators -RunLevel Highest
$settings = New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet -Hidden
Register-ScheduledTask -Action $action -Trigger $trigger -TaskName "restart chocolatey-agent" -Description "Upgrade Chocolatey Agent" -Principal $principal -Settings $settings -Verbose:$false
```

<Callout type="warning">
    Although the `ScheduledTasks` module is available on Windows Server 2012 R2, the [`chocolatey-agent` service encounters an error when trying to import it](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-licensed-issues/issues/273). It is recommended to explore other options for the scheduled task if you're using Windows Server 2012 R2.
</Callout>

## Change Service Account Username or Password

If you need to change the username or password of the Chocolatey Agent, you have a few options:

* Change it through the Windows Service Manager
* Change it during an upgrade by <Xref title="passing the new username/password to the upgrade command" value="setup-agent" anchor="package-parameters" />
* Change it during an uninstall and reinstall while <Xref title="passing the new username/password to the install command" value="setup-agent" anchor="package-parameters" />.

<Callout type="warning">
    The service password cannot be changed through a Chocolatey upgrade command while the service is running.
</Callout>

### Use Chocolatey Central Management to Change the Service Account Username or Password

If you use Chocolatey Central Management, you won't be able to use a Deployment Step to uninstall the agent and then install the agent. This is because the agent cannot change the username/password while is it running. Instead, you can send a Deployment Step that creates a scheduled task to uninstall the agent, then install with the new parameters.

<Callout type="info">
    Due to limitations of Windows Task Scheduler, it is likely that your users will see the PowerShell window initially, but it should disappear once PowerShell has fully started.
</Callout>

An example advanced Deployment Step script to do this is as follows:

```powershell
$delayInMinutes = 1
$newUsername = '<Username>'
$newPassword = '<Password>'

$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Once -At (Get-Date).AddMinutes($delayInMinutes)
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute 'powershell.exe' -Argument "-WindowStyle Hidden -Command choco uninstall chocolatey-agent -y ; choco install chocolatey-agent -y --params='/Username:$newUsername' --package-parameters-sensitive='/Password:$newPassword'"
$principal = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -GroupId Administrators -RunLevel Highest
$settings = New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet -Hidden
Register-ScheduledTask -Action $action -Trigger $trigger -TaskName "Upgrade chocolatey-agent" -Description "Upgrade Chocolatey Agent" -Principal $principal -Settings $settings -Verbose:$false
```

<Callout type="info">
    Be sure to use <Xref title="Sensitive Variables" value="ccm-administration-sensitive-variables" /> to ensure the username and password don't get added to the Chocolatey logs when using Chocolatey Central Management version 0.7.0 or newer.
