### Improvements

## 0.9.0 (March 18, 2019) \{#march-18-2019}

### Features

- Chocolatey Central Management Reporting - Clients can now report into Chocolatey Central Management on a configurable basis. For more information, please see [the documentation](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/features/chocolatey-central-management).

### Bug Fixes

  - Fix - Execution times out after 10 minutes - ignores configuration - see [Licensed #41](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-licensed-issues/issues/41).

## 0.8.1 (September 28, 2017) \{#september-28-2017}

### Bug Fixes

- Fix - bump dependency on Chocolatey Licensed Extension to ensure user is created with complex password instead of created with no password and then updated with complex password.

## 0.8.0 (September 27, 2017) \{#september-27-2017}

### Breaking Changes

- [Security] Use 'ChocolateyLocalAdmin' user and manage the user by default - using LocalSystem doesn't work well with all software installations. Using a local user that is an admin works much better for ensuring applications are installed. If you need the previous functionality, pass `/UseDefaultChocolateyConfigUser`. This will use whatever Chocolatey is configured to use by default for new service installations. You can also pass in a username and optionally a password for a domain account or local administrator account.

### Improvements

- Upgrade - Pass `/NoRestartService` to upgrade the service without shutting down the current running service. You will need to restart the service to take advantage of the new changes - see [#26](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-licensed-issues/issues/26).
- Install/Upgrade - Pick username/password for runtime. Pass `/Username:value /Password:value2` through package parameters.
- Install/Upgrade - Pass `/EnterPassword` through package parameters to have Chocolatey ask for the user password at runtime during installation. Captures as a secure string.

## 0.7.0 (June 27, 2017) \{#june-27-2017}

### Breaking Changes

- Fix - Use a URI with WCF named pipes that doesn't exclusively hold a lock on the root (blocking other services) - see [#12](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-licensed-issues/issues/12).

### Bug Fixes

- Fix - Allow chocolatey.lib (not just calls from choco.exe) to run self-service.

## 0.6.0 (March 20, 2017) \{#march-20-2017}

### Breaking Changes

- Sources must be opted in for self-service if the feature `UseBackgroundServiceWithSelfServiceSourcesOnly` is turned on. This is automatically the case with Chocolatey Licensed v1.10.0+ (and Chocolatey 0.10.4+).

### Bug Fixes

- Fix - Sources using nupkg/nuspec were being allowed. This is now disabled as well.

## 0.5.0 (January 14, 2017) \{#january-14-2017}

### Breaking Changes

- New pattern for dependencies requires a reload of the interface that works between the Agent and Chocolatey.Extension, requiring a bump in the sub v1.

## 0.4.0 (January 4, 2017) \{#january-4-2017}

Initial Release

### Features

- Streams logging messages back to the caller in realtime.
- Audits disallowed calls / attempted abuses of the service.
- Only runs Chocolatey functions.
- Ensures installation from approved sources only.
