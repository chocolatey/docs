By default, when Chocolatey GUI begins what is known to be an operation that can take a while, it will show a loading
modal window.  When this modal is shown, there is the option to also show the console output for the operation that is
currently being executed.

This is what you will see when an operation like this happens, and this feature is disabled:

![Show Console Output Disabled](https://img.chocolatey.org/docs/chocolatey-gui/feature_show_console_output_disabled.png "Show Console Output Disabled")

When this feature becomes enabled, you will be default be able to see the contents of the console output, without having
to first expand it:
