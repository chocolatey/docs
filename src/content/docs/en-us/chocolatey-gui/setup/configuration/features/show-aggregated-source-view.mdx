By default, Chocolatey GUI shows a source view for every feed that is configured for Chocolatey.  Clicking on each tab
will show all of the packages for that selected feed.  As a result, the normal Chocolatey GUI view looks something like
the following:

![Show Aggregated Source Disabled](https://img.chocolatey.org/docs/chocolatey-gui/feature_show_aggregated_source_disabled.png "Show Aggregated Source Disabled")

By enabling this feature, it is possible to add an additional source view, which aggregates all the packages from all
configured sources, into a single view.  Once enabled, you will see a new `All Sources` tab available for selection,
similar to the following:

![Show Aggregated Source Enabled](https://img.chocolatey.org/docs/chocolatey-gui/feature_show_aggregated_source_enabled.png "Show Aggregated Source Enabled")

<Callout type="info">
    When first enabling this feature, it will be necessary to close and re-open Chocolatey GUI in order to see the new source view.
