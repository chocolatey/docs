By default, when using the <Xref title="DefaultToTileViewForLocalSource" value="default-to-tile-view-for-local-source" />, <Xref title="DefaultToTileViewForRemoteSource" value="default-to-tile-view-for-remote-source" />, or the <Xref title="ShowAdditionalPackageInformation" value="show-additional-package-information" /> features, Chocolatey GUI will attempt to download the icon for the package from the URL that is defined within the nuspec file for the package.  For the most part, this works without any problems, however, when being used within an air gapped network, with no internet access, the end result looks like this:

With the PreventAllPackageIconDownloads feature enabled, no attempt will be made to download the icon associated with the package, and instead the default Chocolatey icon will be used for each package.  The result being the following:
