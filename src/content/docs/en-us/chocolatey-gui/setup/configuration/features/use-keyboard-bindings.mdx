By default, Chocolatey GUI ships with some keyboard bindings that make navigating sources easier when using the
keyboard.  In the screenshot below, it is possible to navigate to the `chocolatey.licensed` feed using `CTRL + 3` and
then back to the `This PC` feed using `CTRL + 1`.  It is also possible to navigate to the `chocolatey` feed using
`CTRL + 2`.

![Use Keyboard Bindings](/images/chocolatey-gui/feature_use_keyboard_bindings.png "Use Keyboard Bindings")

Disabling this feature will stop these navigations from being possible using these keyboard shortcuts, but they can
still be navigated to using the mouse in the normal way.

<Callout type="info">
    Keyboard bindings are only supported for the first 9 sources.  Trying to press `CTRL + 1 + 0` for navigating to a tenth source will not work.
