By default (starting with version 0.18.0), Chocolatey GUI uses a tile view to show all of the packages that are currently available on the remote
sources that have been configured.  As a result, you will see a screen similar to the following when first
starting the application and clicking on a remote source:

![Default to Tile View for Remote Source Disabled](/images/chocolatey-gui/feature_default_tile_view_remote_disabled.png "Default to Tile View for Remote Source Disabled")

It is possible to toggle between the list view and a tile view for the packages that are available on a remote source
using the buttons at the top right hand corner of the application, but it you prefer to see the list view by default,
then you can enable it with this feature.  As a result, you will see something like the following when first starting
the application and clicking on a remote source:

![Default to Tile View for Remote Source Enabled](/images/chocolatey-gui/feature_default_tile_view_remote_enabled.png "Default to Tile View for Remote Source Enabled")
