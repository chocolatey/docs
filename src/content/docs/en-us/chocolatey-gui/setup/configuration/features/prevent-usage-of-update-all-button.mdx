Chocolatey GUI has always had the ability to run the equivalent of the `choco upgrade all` command, via the <Xref title="Update All button" value="gui-update-all" />.  However, there are times when you want to provide finer grain control of what packages are being updated at any given time.  As such, this feature allowing removal of the Update All button from the Chocolatey GUI user interface.

By default, the Update All button will be shown:

![Show the update all button in the Chocolatey GUI UI](/images/chocolatey-gui/user_interface_main-window_action_update-all_2.png "Show the update all button in the Chocolatey GUI UI")

however, once this feature is enabled, it will no longer be shown

![Show the update all button removed in the Chocolatey GUI UI](/images/chocolatey-gui/user_interface_main-window_update-all-removed.png "Show the update all button removed in the Chocolatey GUI UI")

<RequireChocolateyGuiLicensedExtensionNote />
