By default, Chocolatey GUI uses a light mode for all of its user interface.  As a result, you will see a screen similar to the following when first starting the application:

![Default to Dark Mode Disabled](/images/chocolatey-gui/feature_default_to_dark_mode_disabled.png "Default to Dark Mode Disabled")

It is possible to toggle between a light and dark mode for the application using the buttons at the top right hand corner of the application, but if you prefer to see the dark mode by default, then you can enable it with this feature.  As a result, you will see something like the following when first starting the application:

![Default to Dark Mode Enabled](/images/chocolatey-gui/feature_default_to_dark_mode_enabled.png "Default to Dark Mode Enabled")
