There are two types of configuration which can be applied to Chocolatey GUI.  The first is a setting (config) value, which could be a string, or a number, which the user can set.  The other is a feature, which can either be turned on or off.  Exposing these configuration options is done through the [config]() and [feature]() commands of the chocolateyguicli executable.
