By default, when Chocolatey GUI opens it will show the "This PC" source, showing all of the locally installed packages.  Depending on your usage of Chocolatey GUI, it may make more sense to default to showing a different source when the application first loads.  By setting this configuration option to the name of a configured source, Chocolatey GUI will show this by default when it first opens.  If the value of the DefaultSourceName setting doesn't match the name of a configured source, then the "This PC" source will be shown.
