Chocolatey GUI, by default, will check for installed packages that are currently outdated (based on available sources) when the application first loads.  However, this can be turned of using the <Xref title="Prevent Automated Outdated Packages Check" value="prevent-automated-outdated-packages-check" /> feature, or there can be changes to packages outside of Chocolatey GUI.  When these situations occur, you can manually invoke the check for outdated packages using the following button:
