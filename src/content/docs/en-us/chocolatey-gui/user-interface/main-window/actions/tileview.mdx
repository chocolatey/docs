Chocolatey GUI provides the ability to toggle between tile view (the default selection) and a list view for both local and remote sources within the application.

The following screenshot illustrates where the buttons to toggle between one view and the other are located:

This is what the User Interface looks like when the tile view is selected:

This is what the User Interface looks like when the list view is selected:

If required, the <Xref title="default selection for local sources" value="default-to-tile-view-for-local-source" /> and the <Xref title="default selection for remote sources" value="default-to-tile-view-for-remote-source" /> can be modified to your personal liking.
