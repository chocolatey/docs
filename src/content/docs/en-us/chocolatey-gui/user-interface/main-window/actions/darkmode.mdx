Chocolatey GUI provides the ability to toggle between light mode (the default selection) and a dark mode within the application.

The following screenshot illustrates where the toggle button is located:

If required, the <Xref title="default selection for light/dark mode" value="default-to-dark-mode" /> can be modified to your personal liking.
