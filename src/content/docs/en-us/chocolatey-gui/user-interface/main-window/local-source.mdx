The "This PC" source, also known as a local source, is the first source that is shown by default when Chocolatey GUI first
opens, and it shows all the currently installed Chocolatey packages.  It is the visual equivalent of running the `choco
list` command in Chocolatey CLI v2, and `choco list -lo` in Chocolatey CLI v1, and paging the results that are displayed.

It is possible to show this view in both tile and list format, and this can be controlled through the <Xref title="toggle switch" value="gui-tileview" />, or
by setting the <Xref title="Default to Tile View for Local Source" value="default-to-tile-view-for-local-source" /> feature to the required setting.

In addition, you may want to use the <Xref title="Prevent Automated Outdated Packages Check" value="prevent-automated-outdated-packages-check" /> feature, to prevent Chocolatey GUI calculating what packages are outdated each time Chocolatey GUI opens. It is possible to directly trigger this check using the <Xref title="Check For Outdated" value="check-for-outdated" /> action.

From the local source view, either by navigating to the <Xref title="package details page" value="gui-package-details" />, or by activating the context menu for the
required package, it is possible to perform one of the <Xref title="available actions" value="gui-package-details-actions" /> for a package.

The local source view can be turned off using the <Xref title="Hide This PC Source" value="hide-this-pc-source" /> feature.  **NOTE:** This is a commercial feature that requires the use of the <Xref title="Chocolatey GUI Licensed Extension" value="chocolatey-gui-licensed-extension" />.
