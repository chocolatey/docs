The Chocolatey Settings screen allow the user to toggle on and off the various features that Chocolatey supports, as
well as to set values for the specific configuration values that exist for Chocolatey.

There are search boxes that allow you to type the name of a feature, or a setting, and the list will be filtered down
to only match entries with the search phrase in either the display name or the configuration name.

Changing the values in this screen is the same as directly calling the `choco feature` or `choco config` commands.  For
more information about exactly what these settings are, and what they can be used for, see the
[Chocolatey documentation](https://chocolatey.org/docs/chocolatey-configuration).
