The Chocolatey GUI Settings screen allows the user to toggle on and off the various features that the application
supports, as well as to set values for the specific configuration values that exist within the application.  Normally,
once changed, the feature or configuration value changes takes immediate effect, but it may require an application
restart to take effect.

There are search boxes that allow you to type the name of a feature, or a setting, and the list will be filtered down
to only match entries with the search phrase in either the display name or the configuration name.
