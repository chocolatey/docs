import Callout from '@choco/components/Callout.astro';
import Iframe from '@choco/components/Iframe.astro';
import Xref from '@components/Xref.astro';

While it is possible to configure all aspects of Chocolatey GUI from within the [Settings]() screen, it is also possible to configure all aspects directly from three commands which are exposed with the `chocolateyguicli` executable.  This executable is installed with the Chocolatey GUI Chocolatey package, and is immediately available in both a PowerShell or Command window.  Three commands, `config`, `feature`, and `purge` are available to control the different aspects of Chocolatey GUI.
