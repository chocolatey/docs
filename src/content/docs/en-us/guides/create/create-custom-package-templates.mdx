As of [choco 0.9.9.9](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/76), you can create your own custom package templates when the built-in template is not enough.

## Overview

A template is used for creating packages. Chocolatey (choco) has a built-in template that it uses when generating a new package from the command <Xref title="`choco new`" value="choco-command-new" />.

### Where do Templates go?

If you drop a template into `$env:ChocolateyInstall\templates` folder, you can use `-t name_of_template` to generate a choco template based on that. So for:

![Windows Explorer showing the installation location for a new template with the name of Organization](/images/features/choco-templates-location.png)

You would call `choco new pkgname -t organization` and choco will use the template folder instead of the built-in template.

### Can I replace the built-in template?

If you are using a version of Chocolatey CLI earlier than 0.12.0, you can replace the built-in template by copying the template to a folder called `default`. The `choco new` command will then use that by default.

Chocolatey CLI version 0.12.0 or later introduced the <Xref title="`choco template` command" value="choco-command-template" />. You can use it to list the installed templates and <Xref title="set the `defaultTemplateName`" value="configuration" anchor="general" /> to set the template to be used by default when running the `choco new` command. You can also still copy the template files that worked with previous versions.

### What values can I template?

You can get the names by running `choco new -h`:

```
Possible properties to pass:
    packageversion
    maintainername
    maintainerrepo
    installertype
    url
    url64
    silentargs
```

However `PackageName` and `PackageNameLower` also show up as they are based on the name of the package that you pass e.g. "bob" in `choco new bob`

Then you surround those templated values with `[[]]` to make them templated for choco to use.

<Callout type="info">
    You can set and pass arbitrary values through as well. This is shown in the example with `CustomValue`.
</Callout>

## Template Example

This is a template for embedding an MSI into a package. This removes almost everything that is unnecessary for embedding software into packages. And because the autoUninstaller handles MSIs without an issue, we don't need a chocolateyUninstall.ps1.

A file with the extension `.nuspec`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<package xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2015/06/nuspec.xsd">
  <metadata>
    <id>[[PackageNameLower]]</id>
    <title>[[PackageName]] (Install)</title>
    <version>[[PackageVersion]]</version>
    <authors>Original authors</authors>
    <owners>[[MaintainerName]]</owners>
    <description>__REPLACE__MarkDown_Okay [[AutomaticPackageNotesNuspec]]
    </description>
    <tags>[[PackageNameLower]] admin</tags>
    <!--<dependencies>
      <dependency id="" version="__VERSION__" />
      <dependency id="" />
    </dependencies>-->
  </metadata>
  <files>
    <file src="tools\**" target="tools" />
  </files>
</package>
```

<Callout type="info">
    Ensure that the template nuspec is encoded as UTF8 with BOM to avoid issues with non-ascii characters. The final package source generated by the template will contain the correct nuspec without a BOM.
</Callout>

`tools\chocolateyInstall.ps1`:

```powershell
# Custom value: [[CustomValue]]
$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'; # stop on all errors

[[AutomaticPackageNotesInstaller]]
$packageName  = '[[PackageName]]'
$toolsDir     = "$(Split-Path -parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Definition)"
$fileLocation = Join-Path $toolsDir 'NAME_OF_EMBEDDED_INSTALLER_FILE'

$packageArgs = @{
  packageName   = $packageName
  file          = $fileLocation
  fileType      = '[[InstallerType]]' #only one of these: exe, msi, msu

  #MSI
  silentArgs    = "/qn /norestart /l*v `"$env:TEMP\chocolatey\$($packageName)\$($packageName).MsiInstall.log`""
  validExitCodes= @(0, 3010, 1641)
  #OTHERS
  #silentArgs   ='[[SilentArgs]]' # /s /S /q /Q /quiet /silent /SILENT /VERYSILENT -s - try any of these to get the silent installer
  #validExitCodes= @(0) #please insert other valid exit codes here
}

Install-ChocolateyInstallPackage @packageArgs
```

Once installed, call this with `choco new test -t <TEMPLATE NAME> CustomValue=Yes`

### Manage Templates as packages

If you have Chocolatey v0.9.10+, you can manage templates as packages allowing you to upgrade a template when a new version is available. When it comes to packaging templates, Chocolatey takes a conventional approach. You must create a package with the suffix ".template" and have a templates folder.

To manage a template as a package, create a new package with the name `<TEMPLATE NAME>.template`. The name of the package minus the ".template" will be the name of the template.

Then create a templates folder next to the `<TEMPLATE NAME>.template.nuspec`. This folder is where the template goes. The only thing to remember is that the nuspec file created here must end in ".template"  (e.g. `<TEMPLATE NAME>.nuspec.template`) as a Chocolatey package allows only one nuspec file.

For examples of template packages see the [templates available on the Chocolatey Community Repository](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages?q=id%3A.template) and the [repository for community maintained templates](https://github.com/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-templates).

Yes, it is really that easy. Enjoy!

### Extending Templates

Walmart has a really good post on extending package templates. You can read that at https://blog.chocolatey.org/2016/10/extending-chocolatey-packaging-at-walmart/
