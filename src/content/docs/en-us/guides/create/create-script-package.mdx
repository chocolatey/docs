This tutorial will focus on creating a Chocolatey script package. This type of package is one which contains one or more PowerShell scripts that are executed by Chocolatey on the target system.
This powerful package type allows you to version system configuration, making reporting and compliance much simpler!

If you have not yet read <Xref title="Preparing Your Environment for Package Creation" value="howto-prepare-env" />, please do so now and ensure
you are ready to go before continuing.

### Creating Your Package

1. Open the `tutorials` folder in VS Code.
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` or use the **View** menu and click on **Command Palette**.
3. Type `Chocolatey:` and select `Create new Chocolatey package` from the list of available commands
4. Give your package a name, e.g. `script-package`.
5. Select `Default Template` when prompted.

### Adding Your PowerShell Script

You can download an example PowerShell script from [here](https://docs.chocolatey.org/downloads/create-embedded-script-package-tutorial.ps1). Once downloaded, place this script inside the `tools` folder of your script package.

Next we'll create an install script that leverages the sample script.

### Create Your Install Script

Open the `chocolateyInstall.ps1` script from the VS Code Explorer pane. Replace the contents of the script with the following:

```powershell
$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop' # stop on all errors
$toolsDir   = "$(Split-Path -parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Definition)"

$script = Join-Path $toolsDir -ChildPath 'example.ps1'

Write-Host "Executing script: $script"
& $script
```

Save and close the file.

### Cleaning Up The Packaging

Our simple example here doesn't require anything special for an upgrade or uninstall scenario. In the VS Code Explorer pane find both the `chocolateyBeforeModify.ps1` and `chocolateyUninstall.ps1` files and remove them.

### Creating The Package Metadata

The package metadata is stored in a file with a `.nuspec` extension. It provides information to Chocolatey such as:

- Package Id
- Package Version
- Author
- Synopsis
- Dependencies

For packages being published to the [Chocolatey Community Repository](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages) additional information is required.
You can find information on package metadata requirements in our <Xref title="Package Validator Rules" value="package-validator-rules" /> documentation.

In the VS Code Explorer pane find and open the `embedded-zip.nuspec` file.

Replace the contents of the nuspec file with the following:

```xml
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->
<package xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2015/06/nuspec.xsd">
  <metadata>
    <id>script-package</id>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <title>script-package (Install)</title>
    <authors>Chocolatey Software</authors>
    <tags>script-package script tutorial</tags>
    <summary>Tutorial for script package</summary>
    <description>Tutorial for script package</description>
  </metadata>
  <files>
    <!-- this section controls what actually gets packaged into the Chocolatey package -->
    <file src="tools\**" target="tools" />
  </files>
</package>
```

### Compile Your Package

The `choco pack` command is used to compile your package files into a usable Chocolatey package.

1. In VS Code press `Ctrl+Shift+P` or use the **View** menu and click on **Command Palette**.
2. Type `Chocolatey:` and click `Chocolatey: Pack Chocolatey package(s)`.
3. Select `script-package.nuspec` from the list.
4. In **Additional arguments** enter `--output-directory='C:\tutorials'` and press `Enter`.

### Install Your Script Package

You can test your package, and see how it behaves with the following command:

```powershell
choco install script-package -y --source='tutorials'
```

### Uninstall Your Script Package

You can test the uninstall behavior with the following:

```powershell
choco uninstall script-package -y
```

### Conclusion

At this point, you should have a working script package! Congratulations! Hopefully you can apply this to other scripts!
