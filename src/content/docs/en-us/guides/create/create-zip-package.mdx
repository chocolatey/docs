At its heart, a Chocolatey package is _just_ PowerShell. This makes Chocolatey packages capable of doing _almost anything_ that PowerShell can do!
In this walk-through we'll learn how to leverage zip archives within our packaging.

If you have not yet read <Xref title="Preparing Your Environment for Package Creation" value="howto-prepare-env" />, please do so now and ensure
you are ready to go before continuing.

### Using `Get-ChocolateyUnzip`

In our first example, we'll leverage <Xref title="`Get-ChocolateyUnzip`" value="get-chocolateyunzip" /> to extract a Zip archive to disk. This function requires
that you include the Zip archive as part of the package. We'll look at downloading an archive from an external location later in our **Creating A Large Package** tutorial.

#### Creating Your Package

Perform the following steps:

1. Open the `tutorials` folder in VS Code.
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` or use the **View** menu and click on **Command Palette**..
3. Type `Chocolatey:` and select `Create new Chocolatey package` from the list of available commands.
4. Give your package a name, e.g. `embedded-zip`.
5. Select `Default Template` when prompted.

#### Creating Your Install Script

Your new package will be created in the `tutorials` folder, visible in the Explorer pane of VS Code.
Expand the `tools` folder and open up the `chocolateyInstall.ps1` file. The `chocolateyInstall.ps1` file is
executed when you run either the `install` or `upgrade` commands with your package. 

The default template fills this file out for us and provides a LOT of information. For our purposes, we can press `Ctrl+A` and delete the contents of this file.

With our install script now empty, paste the following code into the file:

```powershell
$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop' # stop on all errors
$toolsDir   = "$(Split-Path -parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Definition)"
$zipArchive = Join-Path $toolsDir -ChildPath 'tutorial.zip'


$unzipArgs = @{
  FileFullPath = $zipArchive
  Destination = 'C:\zip_tutorial'
}

Get-ChocolateyUnzip @unzipArgs

```

Save `chocolateyInstall.ps1` and close the file.

#### Download Example Zip Archive

[Download the Zip archive](https://docs.chocolatey.org/downloads/create-embedded-zip-package-tutorial.zip) we will use in this tutorial. Once downloaded, copy the Zip archive to the `tools`` directory in your VS Code Explorer pane.

#### Creating Your Uninstall Script

The `chocolateyUninstall.ps1` script is executed you run the `uninstall` command with your package.

In the VS Code Explorer pane, find and open the `chocolateyUninstall.ps1` file. Replace the contents of this file with the following:

```powershell
$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop' # stop on all errors
Uninstall-ChocolateyZipPackage -Packagename $env:ChocolateyPackageName -ZipFileName 'tutorial.zip'

# Uninstall-ChocolateyZipPackage will remove the FILES from the archive.
# If you wish to remove the DIRECTORY they were extracted too,
# you'll additionally have to handle that in this script.
Remove-Item 'C:\zip_tutorial'
```

#### Creating Your `.nuspec` File

The `.nuspec` file is the metadata for your package. It provides information to Chocolatey CLI such as:

- Package ID
- Package Version
- Author
- Synopsis
- Dependencies

For packages being published to the [Chocolatey Community Repository](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages) additional information is required.
You can find information on `.nuspec` requirements in our [Package Validator Rules](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/community-repository/moderation/package-validator/rules/#requirements) documentation.

In the VS Code Explorer pane, find and open the `embedded-zip.nuspec` file. Replace the contents of this file with the following:

```xml
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->
<package xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2015/06/nuspec.xsd">
  <metadata>
    <id>embedded-zip</id>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <title>embedded-zip (Install)</title>
    <authors>Chocolatey Software</authors>
    <tags>embedded-zip zip tutorial</tags>
    <summary>Tutorial for embedded zip file package</summary>
    <description>Tutorial for embedded zip file package</description>
  </metadata>
  <files>
    <!-- this section controls what actually gets packaged into the Chocolatey package -->
    <file src="tools\**" target="tools" />
  </files>
</package>

```

### Compile Your Package

The `pack` command is used to compile your Chocolatey package, giving it a `.nupkg` extension.

1. In VS Code press `Ctrl+Shift+P` or use the **View** menu and click on **Command Palette**.
2. Type `Chocolatey:` and click `Chocolatey: Pack Chocolatey package(s)`.
3. Select `embedded-zip.nuspec` from the list.
4. In **Additional arguments** enter `--output-directory='C:\tutorials'` and press `Enter`.

### Install Your Script Package

You can test your package, and see how it behaves with the following command:

```powershell
choco install embedded-zip -y --source='tutorials'
```

### Uninstall Your Script Package

You can test the uninstall behavior with the following:

```powershell
choco uninstall embedded-zip -y
```

## Conclusion

At this point, you should have a working Zip archive package! Congratulations! Hopefully you can apply this to other Zip archives!
