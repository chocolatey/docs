## Why Has Chocolatey.Server Been Deprecated

The IIS application that houses Chocolatey packages known as Chocolatey.Server has been deprecated due to its difficulty to deploy, maintain, and support. We have delisted the `chocolatey.server` package from the Chocolatey Community Repository and removed documentation for Chocolatey.Server's setup and configuration.

Our suggestion for local housing of Chocolatey Packages is to use a third-party repository solution such as [Inedo ProGet](https://inedo.com/proget). It's free and offers Chocolatey-specific repository feeds to house your Chocolatey packages. [Speaking of which, there's even a Chocolatey package for it](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/proget).

Other repository solutions to consider are [Sonatype Nexus](https://www.sonatype.com/products/sonatype-nexus-repository) and [JFrog Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/), although it's important to note these offerings require payment for their full functionality, and can be prohibitively expensive for organizations.

## I Currently Use Chocolatey.Server. What Should I Do Now?

If Chocolatey.Server functions as you intend, you won't need to do anything at this time. However, there is no commercial support for Chocolatey.Server, and if it ceases to function we will suggest you move to a third-party repository solution such as Inedo ProGet to house your Chocolatey packages.
