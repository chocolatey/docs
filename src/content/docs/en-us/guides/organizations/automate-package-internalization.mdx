## Summary

When running within an organization it is beneficial to use your own, internally controlled, package repository. But that doesn't mean you have to create all packages from scratch. Chocolatey allows you to create packages easily using the <Xref title="package builder" value="package-builder" /> but it also allows you to take packages from the Chocolatey Community Repository and recompile them for internal use - this is a process known as <Xref title="package internalization" value="recompile-packages" />. This guide shows you how to use that within your organization.

## Organizational Requirements

When distributing software across your organization you need confidence and control of your package source. We do not recommend an organization use the [Chocolatey Community Repository](https://chocolatey.org "Chocolatey Community Repository") for the following reasons:

* Trust.
    When using packages within your organization you need to be sure that you can trust the creators and maintainers of those packages. While every package going through the Chocolatey Community Repository undergoes a <Xref title="moderation process" value="moderation" />, the creators and maintainers are strangers to your organization.
* Stability.
    You need a stable and reliable connection to wherever your packages are stored and it needs to be always available during your business hours.
* Control.
    To ensure the packages work in your environment you need to be in control of the testing, approval and release process.

For these reasons, we do not recommend that organizations use the Chocolatey Community Repository as a package source and encourage replacing it with your own internal package source.

### Architecture

Chocolatey recommends you use an architecture that meets the [organizational requirements](#organizational-requirements) as we have shown below.

![Chocolatey Architecture Diagram](/images/internalizer/architecture-diagram.png)

Let's break down the diagram:

1. Package Internalizer - The package internalizer downloads approved packages from the Chocolatey Community Repository and software binaries from their source locations.
1. Source Control - once packages have been internalized we recommend they are stored in source control.
1. Test 'Internal Package Repository' - once internalized by the Package Internalizer, packages are pushed to here for further processing such as being put through automated testing.
1. Production 'Internal Package Repository' - after the package has been processing in the Test 'Internal Package Repository' it will be pushed to your production package source for release to your organization.

While it's not explicitly specified the glue that holds all of this together is automation using a self-hosted CI / CD tool such as [Jenkins](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/jenkins), [GoCD](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/gocdserver), [TeamCity](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/teamcity) etc. While it may be possible to do this with externally hosted solutions using local build agents (such as [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/) or [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)) your mileage may vary.

<Callout type="info">
    The Chocolatey Architecture Diagram shows the services separated. But don't mistake the services for servers. All of these services, package internalizer, source control and package repositories can all be run on one server. There is a caveat however. <Xref title="Chocolatey Server" value="set-up-chocolatey-server" /> can only run one package source per server, so if you use this with a test and production repository source, as we recommend, you will need to run each on separate servers. This limitation does not apply to [Sonatype Nexus](https://www.sonatype.com/nexus-repository-sonatype), [Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/), [ProGet](https://inedo.com/proget), [Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.com) and others.

## Building Your Internal Infrastructure

Lets build the internal infrastructure to support this process.

### Server Pre-Requisites

When creating each server follow these steps:

1. Create a server with [Windows Server 2022](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2022) - Details on how to create a server are beyond the scope of this guide - **don't forget to rename your server to something other than the default name**
1. [Install Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install#installing-chocolatey)
1. Install `baretail`, `notepadplusplus.install` and `7zip` with Chocolatey: `choco install baretail notepadplusplus.install 7zip -y`

### Internal Package Repositories

For this guide we have chosen to use <Xref title="Chocolatey Server" value="set-up-chocolatey-server" /> to host our internal package repository. However as we noted earlier this has the limitation of hosting only one repository per server. For anything more than a simple environment, we recommend you use [Sonatype Nexus](https://www.sonatype.com/nexus-repository-sonatype), [Artifactory Pro](https://jfrog.com/download-artifactory-pro/) or [ProGet](https://inedo.com/proget).

The repositories to setup are for _test_ and _production_ which we will call `testrepo-srv` and `prodrepo-srv`. There are full <Xref title="instructions for setting up Chocolatey server" value="set-up-chocolatey-server" anchor="setup-normally" /> but to make sure we end up with the same result we list specific instructions here. Follow these instructions for each server, `testrepo-srv` and `prodrepo-srv`.

#### Install and Configure Chocolatey Server

Before starting, make sure you install Chocolatey Server on separate servers.

1. [Create a server and ensure you have the pre-requisites](#server-pre-requisites) before continuing.
1. To install and configure Chocolatey Server, run the following PowerShell code (see the comments in the code for more information) in an **elevated Administrator session**:

    ```powershell
    $siteName = 'ChocolateyServer'
    $appPoolName = 'ChocolateyServerAppPool'
    $sitePath = 'c:\tools\chocolatey.server'

    function Add-Acl {
        [CmdletBinding()]
        Param (
            [string]$Path,
            [System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule]$AceObject
        )

        Write-Verbose "Retrieving existing ACL from $Path"
        $objACL = Get-ACL -Path $Path
        $objACL.AddAccessRule($AceObject)
        Write-Verbose "Setting ACL on $Path"
        Set-ACL -Path $Path -AclObject $objACL
    }

    function New-AclObject {
        [CmdletBinding()]
        Param (
            [string]$SamAccountName,
            [System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemRights]$Permission,
            [System.Security.AccessControl.AccessControlType]$AccessControl = 'Allow',
            [System.Security.AccessControl.InheritanceFlags]$Inheritance = 'None',
            [System.Security.AccessControl.PropagationFlags]$Propagation = 'None'
        )

        New-Object -TypeName System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule($SamAccountName, $Permission, $Inheritance, $Propagation, $AccessControl)
    }

    if ($null -eq (Get-Command -Name 'choco.exe' -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)) {
        Write-Warning "Chocolatey not installed. Cannot install standard packages."
        Exit 1
    }

    # Install Chocolatey.Server prereqs
    choco install IIS-WebServer --source=windowsfeatures
    choco install IIS-ASPNET45 --source=windowsfeatures

    # Install Chocolatey.Server
    choco upgrade chocolatey.server -y

    # Step by step instructions here https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/guides/organizations/set-up-chocolatey-server#setup-normally
    # Import the right modules
    Import-Module WebAdministration

    # Disable or remove the Default website
    Get-Website -Name 'Default Web Site' | Stop-Website
    Set-ItemProperty "IIS:\Sites\Default Web Site" serverAutoStart False    # disables website

    # Set up an app pool for Chocolatey.Server. Ensure 32-bit is enabled and the managed runtime version is v4.0 (or some version of 4). Ensure it is "Integrated" and not "Classic".
    New-WebAppPool -Name $appPoolName -Force
    Set-ItemProperty IIS:\AppPools\$appPoolName enable32BitAppOnWin64 True       # Ensure 32-bit is enabled
    Set-ItemProperty IIS:\AppPools\$appPoolName managedRuntimeVersion v4.0       # managed runtime version is v4.0
    Set-ItemProperty IIS:\AppPools\$appPoolName managedPipelineMode Integrated   # Ensure it is "Integrated" and not "Classic"
    Restart-WebAppPool -Name $appPoolName   # likely not needed ... but just in case

    # Set up an IIS website pointed to the install location and set it to use the app pool.
    New-Website -Name $siteName -ApplicationPool $appPoolName -PhysicalPath $sitePath

    # Add permissions to c:\tools\chocolatey.server:
    'IIS_IUSRS', 'IUSR', "IIS APPPOOL\$appPoolName" | ForEach-Object {
        $obj = New-AclObject -SamAccountName $_ -Permission 'ReadAndExecute' -Inheritance 'ContainerInherit','ObjectInherit'
        Add-Acl -Path $sitePath -AceObject $obj
    }

    # Add the permissions to the App_Data subfolder:
    $appdataPath = Join-Path -Path $sitePath -ChildPath 'App_Data'
    'IIS_IUSRS', "IIS APPPOOL\$appPoolName" | ForEach-Object {
        $obj = New-AclObject -SamAccountName $_ -Permission 'Modify' -Inheritance 'ContainerInherit', 'ObjectInherit'
        Add-Acl -Path $appdataPath -AceObject $obj
    }
    ```

1. We shouldn't need to reboot the server but let's do it so we know everything is ready to go.
1. From the server, open the browser and visit `https://localhost` - you will see some instructions but you need to note the password near the bottom. As this is a test environment we don't need to change this however **for a production environment follow the instructions to change the password**.
1. Finally test the Chocolatey Server is working. From the server use the command `choco search --source="'http://localhost/chocolatey'"`;

Once this is done for both servers, you will have two repositories:

1. Test Repository:
   * Name: `testrepo-srv`
   * push URL: `https://testrepo-srv/chocolatey`
1. Production Repository:
   * Name: `prodrepo-srv`
   * Push URL: `https://prodrepo-srv/chocolatey`

### Install and Configure Jenkins Server

[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) is a Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (often called CI/CD) tool that does the automation required to automatically manage the packages between the test and production repositories.

To install and configure Jenkins:

1. [Create a server and ensure you have the pre-requisites](#server-pre-requisites) before continuing.
1. Install Jenkins using Chocolatey: `choco install jenkins -y`
1. Once Jenkins is installed it will open a web browser and take you to the configuration web page (if it does not open for any reason, open the web browser and browse to `http://localhost:8080`.
   * The first page will refresh once Jenkins is installed. If it does not click `ENABLE AUTO REFRESH` in the top left-hand corner.
   * Unlock Jenkins by following the instructions on the page (you need to open the file it specifies, with Notepad), finding the password and pasting it into the box and click **Continue**.
   * For this guide, click **Install Suggested Plugins** and wait for them to install.
   * On the _Create First Admin_ page, click **Continue as admin**
   * On the _Instance Configuration_ page, click **Save and Finish**
   * On the _Jenkins is ready!_ page, click **Start using Jenkins**
1. As the code we will be running in the Jenkins jobs is PowerShell, we need to add the PowerShell plugin.
   * On the home page, click **Manage Jenkins**
   * Click **Manage Plugins**

   ![Jenkins PowerShell Plugin](/images/internalizer/jenkins-ps-plugin.png)

   * Click the **Available plugins** tab
   * In the _Filter_ box type `PowerShell`
   * Tick the _PowerShell_ plugin and click **Install without Restart**
   * Click **Go back to the top page**
1. Copy your Chocolatey Business license to `ProgramData\chocolatey\license` in the root of the system drive.
1. Run the command `choco install chocolatey.extension -y`

Jenkins requires several PowerShell scripts to automate the processes. Create a directory on the root of your System Drive (normally `C:\`) called `scripts` and create each script file there.

```

We're now ready to create the jobs to work with the repository.

#### Create Jenkins Jobs

To allow us to automatically manage the test and production repository we will create three Jenkins jobs to:

* Automatically update any out-of-date packages in the test repository from the Chocolatey Community Repository.
* Allow us to download a package from the Chocolatey Community Repository and submit it to our test repository.
* To automatically determine which packages are new or updated on the test repository, test them and submit them to the production repository.

Each job is detailed below. Use these details to create a new job:

1. From the Jenkins home page, click **New Item**
1. Enter the item name, click **Pipeline** and click **OK**
1. Complete the details page for each job and click **OK**

##### Jenkins Job Details: Update Test Repository

Below are the details for the Jenkins job to update the test repository from the Chocolatey Community Repository. This job will check the test repository against the Chocolatey Community Repository and download any updated packages, internalize them and submit them to the test repository. If successful it will then trigger the job named **Update Production Repository**.

* **General Tab**
  * _Item Name_: **Update test repository from Chocolatey Community Repository**

## Test the Jenkins Automation (Exercises)

To ensure our automation pipeline works, lets conduct tests.

### Submit a new package

Before submitting a new package lets make sure we have no packages in our test or production repositories (all of these commands are run on the Jenkins server):

1. To check the test repository, enter this at the command line `choco search --source="'http://testrepo-srv/chocolatey'"`. You should get this returned (note that the actual version of Chocolatey you see may be different):

    ```powershell
    PS> choco search --source="'http://testrepo-srv/chocolatey'"
    Chocolatey v2.0.0 Business
    0 packages found.
    ```

1. To check the production repository, enter this at the command line `choco search --source="'http://prodrepo-srv/chocolatey'"`. You should get this returned (note that the actual version of Chocolatey you see may be different):

    ```powershell
    PS> choco search --source="'http://prodrepo-srv/chocolatey'"
    Chocolatey v2.0.0 Business
    0 packages found.
    ```

   Follow these steps to add a new package:

1. On the Jenkins homepage, click the little drop down arrow to the right of the **Internalize packages from the Community Repository** job and click **Build with Parameters**.
1. In the parameters page enter `adobereader` in the **P_PKG_LIST** and click the **Build** button.

   You can check the progress of the job by click on the **Last build (#..** link under _Permalinks_ on that page and see the output by clicking on **Console Output** on the right hand side of that page.

   This Jenkins job will run and then, if it is successful will trigger the job named **Update production repository** which will update the production repository with any new or updated packages in the test repository, in this case the `adobereader` package we just added. To see this:

1. To check the test repository, enter this at the command line `choco search --source="'http://testrepo-srv/chocolatey'"`. You should get this returned (note that the actual version of `adobereader` and Chocolatey you see may be different):

    ```powershell
    PS> choco search --source="'http://testrepo-srv/chocolatey'"
    Chocolatey v2.0.0 Business
    adobereader 2015.007.20033.02
    1 packages found.
    ```

1. To check the production repository, enter this at the command line `choco search --source="'http://prodrepo-srv/chocolatey'"`. You should get this returned (note that the actual version of `adobereader` and Chocolatey you see may be different):

    ```powershell
    PS> choco search --source="'http://prodrepo-srv/chocolatey'"
    Chocolatey v2.0.0 Business
    adobereader 2015.007.20033.02
    1 packages found.
    ```

### Updating a package from the Chocolatey Community Repository

As packages get out of date in your test repository you need to update them from the Chocolatey Community Repository. Before we start let's add an older version of a package.

1. Download and internalize the `putty.install` package to the current directory by entering this on the command line: `choco download putty.install --version 0.70 --internalize --force --internalize-all-urls --append-use-original-location --output-directory . --source="'https://community.chocolatey.org/api/v2/'"`;
1. Submit the internalized package to the test repository by entering this on the command line: `choco push putty.install.0.70.nupkg --source="'http://testrepo-srv/chocolatey'" --api-key="'chocolateyrocks'" -force`
1. Go back to Jenkins and run the job **Update production repository** with default parameters. This will test the `putty.install` package and push it to the production repository.
1. Go to the command line and run `choco search --source="'http://prodrepo-srv/chocolatey'"` and you should see these results (note that if you didn't follow the [exercise above](#submit-a-new-package) then `adobereader` will not be in the list):

    ```powershell
    PS> choco search --source="'http://prodrepo-srv/chocolatey'"
    Chocolatey v2.0.0 Business
    adobereader 2015.007.20033.02
    putty.install 0.70
    2 packages found.
    ```

1. Go back to Jenkins and run the job **Update test repository from Chocolatey Community Repository** with default parameters. This will check the test repository against the Chocolatey Community Repository and update the `putty.install` package;
1. Go to the command line and run `choco search --source="'http://testrepo-srv/chocolatey'" --all-versions` and you should see these results (note that if you didn't follow the [exercise above](#submit-a-new-package) then `adobereader` will not be in the list and the latest version of `putty.install` may be different):

    ```powershell
    PS> choco search --source="'http://testrepo-srv/chocolatey'"
    Chocolatey v2.0.0 Business
    adobereader 2015.007.20033.02
    putty.install 0.70.0.20171219
    putty.install 0.70
    3 packages found.
    ```

1. As the Jenkins job **Update test repository from Chocolatey Community Repository** we ran earlier triggers the job **Update production repository**, the `putty.install` package will be automatically tested and pushed to the production repository. To check this, run the following on the command line `choco search --source="'http://prodrepo-srv/chocolatey'" --all-versions` and you should see these results (note that if you didn't follow the [exercise above](#submit-a-new-package) then `adobereader` will not be in the list and the latest version of `putty.install` may be different)

    ```powershell
    PS> choco search --source="'http://prodrepo-srv/chocolatey'"
    Chocolatey v2.0.0 Business
    adobereader 2015.007.20033.02
    putty.install 0.70.0.20171219
    putty.install 0.70
    3 packages found.
    ```
