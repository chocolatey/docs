By default, Chocolatey CLI uses the Temp Folder for downloads. However, that is sometimes blocked by Group Policy and/or other things. To change that you need to adjust the cache location in your Chocolatey CLI config file using `choco config set --name="'cacheLocation'" --value="'<CACHE LOCATION PATH>'"`. See the <Xref title="config command" value="choco-command-config" /> for more details.
