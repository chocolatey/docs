Chocolatey CLI brings with it the concept of a **Universal Packaging format for Windows**. At the heart of this is <Xref title="PowerShell" value="packaging-for-the-masses" />, the automation language for Windows.

With a Windows computer, you can do pretty much _anything_ with PowerShell, and you can pretty much do _anything_ within a Chocolatey package.

Packages have many different uses cases:

- **Install, upgrade and remove software using the distributed installer**. That installer could be an MSI, an EXE, AppX, MSIX or other type of installer.
- **Add or remove a standalone executable binary file**. The binary file will be on the PATH automatically so the end-user just needs to run it anywhere from the command line. You could add a link on the desktop or Start menu for the desktop experience.
- **Unzip an archive file**. The contents of the archive file can then be used in the way intended: running software, importing into other software or saved for later processing.
- **Adding, updating or removing Windows components and libraries**. Add DLL's, code libraries and other types of Windows components and register them if necessary.
- **Adding, updating or removing scripts**. The scripts can then be available for the end-user to run as normal.
- **Adding, updating or removing registry keys**. Once the registry key files are on the computer, you can import these with standard PowerShell.
- **Importing, or removing, a license. Deploy a license to your computer**. <Xref title="We use this type of package to ensure Chocolatey for Business is licensed" value="organizational-deployment-guide" anchor="exercise-4-create-a-package-for-the-license" />.
- Many more use cases. See [packages types](#package-types) below.

The benefit comes in knowing what version of these artifacts are deployed onto the computer and, as a result, you will know when some of these artifacts need to be updated. Gone are the days of guessing what version of software, or what license, is deployed onto any given computer.

When you couple this with the knowledge that a single Chocolatey package can take a dependency on another Chocolatey package, then you can quite quickly see how simple it can be to chain together a complex installation scenario. For example, let's imagine that you want to install the [`vscode` package](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/vscode), but you also wanted to perform some custom configuration after the installation was performed. You could create a separate package called `vscode-config`, which takes a dependency on `vscode`, and in that package, you could perform all the necessary configuration that you wanted to achieve. Then, when you run:

```powershell
choco install vscode-config
```

Chocolatey CLI will first ensure that all dependencies for this package are met, and will install the `vscode` package. Once complete, the `vscode-config` package will be installed, and your custom configuration will be applied. The beauty of this approach is separation of concerns that can be achieved. Here the installation of `vscode` is completed as a single unit of work, and then the custom configuration is applied afterward.

## Package Types

While there is one **Universal Packaging format for Windows**, there are a few different package types:

- **Package managing software and Windows components**. This package can be used to install, upgrade or uninstall software using the <Xref title="native installer" value="howto-create-msi-package" />, an <Xref title="archive file" value="howto-create-zip-package" /> or <Xref title="standalone executable binary file" value="howto-create-cli-package" />.
- **Package managing scripts**. This package can be used to <Xref title="add scripts and other code to the computer" value="howto-create-script-package" /> for use by the end-user, other scripts, modules or applications.
- **Chocolatey extension package**. This package type is used to install, upgrade or uninstall <Xref title="custom PowerShell code that is used by other Chocolatey packages" value="howto-create-extension-package" />. The Community maintained [`chocolatey-core.extension`](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey-core.extension) package is a good example of this.
- **Chocolatey template package**. Chocolatey CLI comes with a default template type that is used when you run `choco new`. You can create <Xref title="your own templates" value="howto-create-package-template" /> to make repeated packaging, easier.
- **Chocolatey hook package**. A hook package allows <Xref title="custom scripts to be run at the start, or end, of Chocolatey CLI packaging operations" value="howto-create-hook-package" />.

With a Windows computer, you can do pretty much _anything_ with PowerShell, and you can pretty much do _anything_ within a Chocolatey package.
