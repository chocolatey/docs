## Summary
Chocolatey has over 10,000 packages already built and available on the [Chocolatey Community Repository](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages). If you want to put those packages to use in your organization, look no further than **Package Internalizer**!

Many of those packages are subject to distribution rights and thus have an internet dependency (which creates both <Xref title="trust and control issues" value="community-packages-disclaimer" />). **Internalizing** is the process for downloading those packages for use with internal or embedded locations for the software (this may also be referred to as 'recompiling').

Package Internalizer can:

* Be fully scripted and used directly in the command line.
* Control dependency resolution for packages needing additional software to function.
* Internalize specific versions of packages.
* Integrate with automation engines such as Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, and more.

Package Internalizer is able to automatically download packages and resources, edit the scripts, remove internet dependencies, and then recompile the packages, saving you hours of time in <Xref title="manually internalizing/recompiling packages" value="recompile-packages" />!

## FAQ

### How does it work?

It downloads a package locally, then it looks at the install script to determine if there are remote resources which are downloaded to a directory in the package (or placed on a file share or setup for an HTTP location; this can be changed with a switch). It then edits the install script to use the local resources and recompiles the package. The process takes about as long as it takes to download the remote resources.

### Does it work with all types of packages?

Some packages are already internalized or don't have remote resources. In those cases it will just download the existing package and have it available for pushing to an internal repository.

### It was not able to download a resource. Why not?

There are a few resources that it may have issues with, especially if variables with methods are used (e.g. `$(somevar).Replace(".","")`). In those cases it attempts to warn you ahead of time that it cannot handle those yet. Future versions of the licensed edition will support advanced scenarios such as these.

### Are all packages guaranteed to be compatible?

Unfortunately, not all packages on the Chocolatey Community Repository are created equal, even with the rigorous <Xref title="moderation" value="moderation" /> process.

Typically, Chocolatey will let you know when a package does not use built-in functions for acquiring files from the internet, and will allow you to inspect the package to finish up the next steps of internalization. Although a small subset of packages are created in this way, this scenario may be supported in a future enhancement.
