## Summary

When you need a package for unattended deployment across your organization, there's nothing faster than **Package Builder**.

Let Package Builder do the heavy lifting and create packages ready for deployments in as little as 5-10 seconds!

Package Builder can:
- Generate packages based on installers and zips from local _and_ remote locations using 32-bit or 64-bit URLs, or both at the same time
- Automatically detect silent arguments, removing the need to use third-party investigation tools
- Work with automation to update a package when a new version of the software inside is released, eliminating the need for manual package updates
- Work with <Xref title="Package Templates" value="create-custom-package-templates"/> to increase ease-of-use and provide simplicity to a complex process

When compared to manually installing software on multiple machines, creating a package for deployment is much more efficient; spending time up front to create
the package means you don't need to manually install or upgrade the software directly on the machine. When combined with <Xref title="Central Management" value="central-management"/>, installing and upgrading your
endpoints becomes virtually effortless.

## See It In Action
Package Builder can be used two ways: directly from the command line or through an interactive user interface. The short video below demonstrates both to detail its user flexibility!

## FAQ

### How does it work?

It inspects the installer file using a series of rules that helps determine the installer type. From there it builds a package with the information it is able to extract from the installer.

### What types of extensions are supported?

Package Builder supports `.exe`, `.msi`, `.msu`, `.msp`, `.7z`, and `.zip`.

### Will it catch all types of installers?

It is able to detect 12 types of installers currently.

### Does it always find the silent uninstall arguments?

In over 70% of the cases it will, but not always. Even with this in mind, it still removes 90% of the packaging work. When it can't create a fully unattended software deployment, it will create a TODO file for you to complete. See the next question on how to handle cases where it cannot.

### This was unable to detect custom installer arguments.

Unfortunately, some installers out there are just a pain to work with. In the case of custom installers, you may be able to find the silent arguments for install and uninstall by searching online. If you cannot find anything, consider unpacking the installer and putting the software binaries directly in the package.

### Does it create automatic unattended files?

Unfortunately not. See the <Xref title="automatic internalize and recompile packages feature" value="automate-package-internalization" /> to take advantage of thousands of existing packages without a need for internet access.

### Does it work with zip archive?

Yes, although somewhat naively. It will generate the packaging to unpack the archive for both 7z and zip files.

### Does this work with keeping the installer on a UNC share or elsewhere yet?

Yes, as of Licensed version v1.6.0+. Use `--use-original-location`.
