## Requirements

- <Xref title="A supported version of Windows" value="chocolatey-components-dependencies-and-support-lifecycle" anchor="supported-windows-versions" />.
- <Xref title="A supported version of PowerShell" value="chocolatey-components-dependencies-and-support-lifecycle" anchor="supported-powershell-versions" />

### Chocolatey CLI v2.0+

- .NET Framework 4.8
  - The installation script will attempt to install .NET 4.8 if it is not installed.

### Chocolatey CLI v1.x

- .NET Framework 4+
  - The installation will attempt to install .NET 4.0 if you do not have it installed
  - .NET Framework 4.5+ is required for installing directly from the Chocolatey Community Repository, due to the [TLS 1.2 requirement](https://blog.chocolatey.org/2020/01/remove-support-for-old-tls-versions/)

## Installing Chocolatey CLI

1. First, ensure that you are using an **[administrative shell](https://www.howtogeek.com/194041/how-to-open-the-command-prompt-as-administrator-in-windows-10/)**.
   - Refer to [Non-Administrative Installation](#non-administrative-install) for information on installing without administrative rights.
1. Copy the text specific to your command shell - [cmd.exe](#install-with-cmd.exe) or [powershell.exe](#install-with-powershell.exe).
1. Paste the copied text into your shell and press Enter.
1. Wait a few seconds for the command to complete.
1. If you don't see any errors, you are ready to use Chocolatey CLI!
1. Type `choco` or `choco -?` now, or see <Xref title="Getting Started" value="getting-started" /> for usage instructions.

#### Install with cmd.exe

Run the following command:

```powershell

@"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"

```

#### Install with PowerShell.exe

With PowerShell, there is an additional step. You must ensure [Get-ExecutionPolicy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170) is not Restricted. We suggest using `Bypass` to bypass the policy to get things installed or `AllSigned` for quite a bit more security.

* Run `Get-ExecutionPolicy`. If it returns `Restricted`, then run `Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned` or `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process`.
* Now run the following command:

```powershell

Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

```

#### Additional considerations

<Callout type="info">
    Please inspect [https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1](https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1) prior to running any of these scripts to ensure safety. We already know it's safe, but you should verify the security and contents of **any** script from the internet you are not familiar with. All of these scripts download a remote PowerShell script and execute it on your machine.
</Callout>

We take security very seriously. <Xref title="Learn more" value="security" />.

> "Why do I need to enable TLS 1.2 in PowerShell? Shouldn't it be on by default when I load PowerShell?"

Unfortunately it's not always a default, and more of the time it is not.  The low level is that it depends on .NET Framework and Windows.

* Explicitly set - Basically you need .NET Fx 4.5 at a minimum to be able to explicitly set TLS 1.2.
* Load by default - To have it load by default when you run PowerShell, you need at least .NET Fx 4.7 AND the Operating System's SystemDefault to have TLS 1.2 enabled.

The load by default is really hard to see, so you should check to ensure it is there. Assume it doesn't and set explicitly.

### Install from PowerShell v3+

<Callout type="info">
    The command for installing with PowerShell at the top of the page works for all versions of PowerShell from v2 on. This is provided as an additional note for folks who want a more terse command that is easier to remember.
</Callout>

With PowerShell, there is an additional step or two. You must ensure [Get-ExecutionPolicy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170) is not Restricted. We suggest using `Bypass` to bypass the policy to get things installed or `AllSigned` for quite a bit more security.

* Run `Get-ExecutionPolicy`. If it returns `Restricted`, then run `Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned` or `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`.
* Now run the following command:

```powershell

Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iwr https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | iex

```

### Install using the MSI?

<Callout type="info">
    The MSI is intended to bootstrap Chocolatey CLI onto a computer and will _only_ install. It cannot upgrade, or uninstall Chocolatey CLI.
</Callout>

From version 2.0.0 of Chocolatey CLI we provide an MSI for installation, allowing you to deploy using your existing tools. Once installed, use Chocolatey CLI as normal to upgrade.

The MSI is provided as an asset on each GitHub release of Chocolatey CLI 2.0.0 onwards. See the assets section on the [Chocolatey GitHub repository release page](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/releases).

### Install using WinGet

You can install Chocolatey CLI version 2.0.0 and later through WinGet by running `winget install --id chocolatey.chocolatey --source winget`. Once installed, use Chocolatey CLI as normal to upgrade.

### Completely offline install

With completely offline use of Chocolatey, you want to ensure you remove the default community package source (`choco source list` followed by `choco source remove --name chocolatey`, or however you would do that with a configuration manager [like Puppet](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/chocolatey#sources-configuration)).

1. The first step with offline is to obtain a copy of the Chocolatey Nupkg (nupkg files are just fancy zip files). Go to https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey and find a version you want.
1. Click on Download to download that version's nupkg file.

  ![download chocolatey.nupkg visual](/images/DownloadChocolateyPackage.png)

1. You can also download [the latest version directly](https://community.chocolatey.org/api/v2/package/chocolatey).
1. You can put the chocolatey.nupkg on an internal package repository and then address that full path, similar to how you see in the Puppet provider - https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/chocolatey/readme#manage-chocolatey-installation
1. Then you would run a script similar to the below to address that local install. If it is on a repository somewhere, you will need to enhance the below script to get that file  (the Chocolatey Puppet provider install script shows that).

```powershell
# Download and install Chocolatey nupkg from an OData (HTTP/HTTPS) url such as Artifactory, Nexus, ProGet (all of these are recommended for organizational use), or Chocolatey.Server (great for smaller organizations and POCs)
# This is where you see the top level API - with xml to Packages - should look nearly the same as https://community.chocolatey.org/api/v2/
# If you are using Nexus, always add the trailing slash or it won't work
# === EDIT HERE ===
$packageRepo = '<INSERT ODATA REPO URL>'

# If the above $packageRepo repository requires authentication, add the username and password here. Otherwise these leave these as empty strings.
$repoUsername = ''    # this must be empty is NOT using authentication
$repoPassword = ''    # this must be empty if NOT using authentication

# Determine unzipping method
# 7zip is the most compatible, but you need an internally hosted 7za.exe.
# Make sure the version matches for the arguments as well.
# Built-in does not work with Server Core, but if you have PowerShell 5
# it uses Expand-Archive instead of COM
$unzipMethod = 'builtin'
#$unzipMethod = '7zip'
#$7zipUrl = 'https://chocolatey.org/7za.exe' (download this file, host internally, and update this to internal)

# === ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES YOU CAN SET ===
# Prior to running this script, in a PowerShell session, you can set the
# following environment variables and it will affect the output

# - $env:ChocolateyEnvironmentDebug = 'true' # see output
# - $env:chocolateyIgnoreProxy = 'true' # ignore proxy
# - $env:chocolateyProxyLocation = '' # explicit proxy
# - $env:chocolateyProxyUser = '' # explicit proxy user name (optional)
# - $env:chocolateyProxyPassword = '' # explicit proxy password (optional)

# === NO NEED TO EDIT ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE ===
# Ensure we can run everything
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force;

# If the repository requires authentication, create the Credential object

### Install with Puppet

<Callout type="info">
    If you have the licensed edition, see <Xref title="Setting up Licensed Edition with Puppet" value="setup-licensed" anchor="set-up-licensed-edition-with-puppet" /> instead. This only additionally contains some package examples and setting up tab completion.
</Callout>

Here's an example of setting Chocolatey up with Puppet that sets up and configures Chocolatey, sets up an internal package repository, and shows setting up the licensed edition and ensuring some packages.

* Download the chocolatey.nupkg from the community repository - [download the latest chocolatey nupkg](https://community.chocolatey.org/api/v2/package/chocolatey) or see [Completely offline install](#completely-offline-install) to get an older version.
* Optionally download the chocolatey.server package from the community repository - [download the latest chocolatey.server nupkg](https://community.chocolatey.org/api/v2/package/chocolatey.server).
* Use `choco push` to push those items to your internal package repository (e.g. `choco push chocolatey.0.10.7.nupkg --source http://internal_repo/ --api-key abc123`)
* Determine how to get the bare url to download the Chocolatey.Nupkg directly. You will need that for the internal url for installing Chocolatey offline. For the community repository, it is https://community.chocolatey.org/api/v2/package/chocolatey


```puppet
# Requires puppetlabs/chocolatey module
# See https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/chocolatey

## Set resource defaults for `package` resources on Windows to use the Chocolatey provider
case $operatingsystem {
  'windows':    {
    Package {
      provider => chocolatey,
    }
  }
}

## - Ensure Chocolatey Install -
#include chocolatey
## OR
## Download chocolatey.nupkg to your internal repository (see above
##  about getting the package for offline use)
## Note: `chocolatey_download_url is completely different than normal
##  source locations. This is directly to the bare download url for the
##  chocolatey.nupkg, similar to what you see when you browse to
##  https://community.chocolatey.org/api/v2/package/chocolatey
class {'chocolatey':
  chocolatey_download_url => 'https://<internalurl/to>/chocolatey.nupkg',
  use_7zip                => false,
}

## If you need FIPS compliance
## make this the first thing you configure before you do any additional
## configuration or package installations
#chocolateyfeature {'useFipsCompliantChecksums':
#  ensure => enabled,
#}

## Keep chocolatey up to date based on your internal source
## You control the upgrades based on when you push an updated version
##  to your internal repository.
## Note the source here is to the OData feed, similar to what you see
##  when you browse to https://chocolatey.org/api/v2
package {'chocolatey':
  ensure   => latest,
  provider => chocolatey,
  source   => 'https://<internal_repo>/chocolatey',
}


## - Configure Chocolatey -
### Config Settings

## Move cache location so Chocolatey is very deterministic about
## cleaning up temporary data
chocolateyconfig {'cacheLocation':
  value => 'c:\ProgramData\chocolatey\choco-cache',
}

## Increase timeout to 4 hours
chocolateyconfig {'commandExecutionTimeoutSeconds':
  value => '14400',
}

### Sources
## Remove the default community package repository source
chocolateysource {'chocolatey':
  ensure   => absent,
  location => 'https://community.chocolatey.org/api/v2/',
}

## Add default sources for your internal repositories
chocolateysource {'internal_chocolatey':
  ensure   => present,
  location => 'http://internal_location/OData/endpoint',
  priority => 1,
  username => 'optional',
  password => 'optional,not ensured',
}

### Features
chocolateyfeature {'checksumFiles':
  ensure => enabled,
}

## When using Puppet for installs
chocolateyfeature {'showDownloadProgress':
  ensure => disabled,
}

chocolateyfeature {'useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades':
  ensure => enabled,
}


## - Chocolatey Simple Server Package Repository -
## Requires chocolatey/chocolatey_server module  - see
##  https://forge.puppet.com/chocolatey/chocolatey_server
## this contains the bits to install the custom server
## - Ensures IIS and Ensure ASP.NET
## - Installs and configures the Chocolatey.Server website and app pool
## - Sets permissions appropriately

#include chocolatey_server
## OR
## `server_package_source` is to the OData feed, similar to what you see
##  when you browse to https://chocolatey.org/api/v2
class {'chocolatey_server':
  server_package_source => 'https://internalurl/odata/server',
}

chocolateysource {'local_chocolatey_server':
  ensure   => present,
  location => 'http://localhost/chocolatey',
  priority => 2,
}


## - Tab Completion -
## Ensure that when someone uses choco from powershell.exe, they have tab completion
file {'C:/Users/Administrator/Documents/WindowsPowerShell':
  ensure => directory,
}

file {'C:/Users/Administrator/Documents/WindowsPowerShell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1':
  ensure => file,
  content => '$ChocolateyProfile = "$env:ChocolateyInstall\helpers\chocolateyProfile.psm1"
if (Test-Path($ChocolateyProfile)) {
  Import-Module "$ChocolateyProfile"
}',
}


## - Package Examples -
package {'roundhouse':
  ensure   => '0.8.5.0',
}

package {'git':

### Install using PowerShell from cmd.exe

This is the best method if you want to repeat it or include it in source control. It requires no change to your existing PowerShell to allow for remote unsigned scripts.

Create a file named `installChocolatey.cmd` with the following:

```
@echo off

SET DIR=%~dp0%

::download install.ps1
%systemroot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "((new-object net.webclient).DownloadFile('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1','%DIR%install.ps1'))"
::run installer
%systemroot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "& '%DIR%install.ps1' %*"
```

You can also get to this file by going to [https://community.chocolatey.org/installChocolatey.cmd](https://community.chocolatey.org/installChocolatey.cmd).

If you prefer to have the install.ps1 file already, comment out the download line in the batch file and download the [`install.ps1`](https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1) from [community.chocolatey.org](https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1) and save it as `install.ps1` next to the `installChocolatey.cmd` file.

Run `installChocolatey.cmd` from an elevated `cmd.exe` command prompt and it will install the latest version of Chocolatey. You can not run this from `powershell.exe` without making changes to your execution policy.

<Callout type="info">
    To create and save a `.cmd` file, please use a text editor and nothing fancy like Microsoft Word or OneNote.
</Callout>

### Install using NuGet Package Manager

When you have Visual Studio 2010+ and the NuGet extension installed (pre-installed on any newer versions of Visual Studio), you can simply type the following three commands and you will have Chocolatey installed on your machine.

* `Install-Package chocolatey`
* `Initialize-Chocolatey`
* `Uninstall-Package chocolatey`

### Install using NuGet.exe from PowerShell

You can also use NuGet command line to download Chocolatey:

 `nuget install chocolatey` or `nuget install chocolatey -pre`

Once you download it, open PowerShell (remote unsigned), navigate to the tools folder and run:

`& .\chocolateyInstall.ps1`

### Install downloaded NuGet package from PowerShell

You can also just download and unzip the Chocolatey package (`.nupkg` is a fancy zip file):

 1. Download the [Chocolatey package](https://community.chocolatey.org/api/v2/package/chocolatey/).
 1. Ensure the downloaded nupkg is not blocked.
 1. Unzip it using any application that supports `zip` format.
 1. Open a PowerShell command shell and navigate into the unzipped package's tools folder.
    <Callout type="info">
        Ensure PowerShell execution policy is set to at least bypass or remote signed (if you have issues, you may need to set it to Unrestricted).
    </Callout>
 1. Call `& .\chocolateyInstall.ps1` to allow Chocolatey to install.
    <Callout type="info">
        This will not set Chocolatey as an installed package, so it may be a good idea to also call `choco upgrade chocolatey -y` and let it reinstall the same version, but at least it will be available for upgrades then.
    </Callout>

### Install licensed edition

Please see <Xref title="installation of licensed edition" value="setup-licensed" />.

### Installing behind a proxy

Have a proxy? Try

* Cmd.exe:

```powershell

@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "[System.Net.WebRequest]::DefaultWebProxy.Credentials = [System.Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultCredentials; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET PATH="%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"

```

* PowerShell.exe (Ensure [Get-ExecutionPolicy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170) is at least RemoteSigned):

```powershell

[System.Net.WebRequest]::DefaultWebProxy.Credentials = [System.Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultCredentials; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

```

### Installing behind an explicit proxy

See <Xref title="Installing Chocolatey Behind a Proxy Server" value="proxy-settings" anchor="installing-chocolatey-behind-a-proxy-server" />

### Installing to a different location

The Chocolatey installation script looks for the `ChocolateyInstall` environment variable in order to identify where it should install to. If this environment variable does not exist, it will install Chocolatey to the default location. In order to install to a non-default location, you should set this variable in a way that it is available in the process that will be running the install script. For example you could set the environment variable through the [Windows GUI](https://www.howtogeek.com/787217/how-to-edit-environment-variables-on-windows-10-or-11/), or you could use `setx`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/setx).

You can validate that PowerShell has the environment variable by running: `Write-Host $env:ChocolateyInstall`

1. Create an environment variable named `ChocolateyInstall` and set it to the folder you want Chocolatey to install to prior to installation.
1. Don't use `"C:\Chocolatey"` unless necessary.
1. If you have already installed (and want to change the location after the fact):
    * Follow the above steps.
    * Install Chocolatey again.
    * Copy/Move over the items from the old lib/bin directory.
    * Delete your old install directory.

<Callout type="info">
    There is one really important consideration when installing Chocolatey to a non-default location: Chocolatey only locks down the permissions to Admins when installed to the default location `%PROGRAMDATA%\Chocolatey`, which means the same thing as `%SystemDrive%\ProgramData\Chocolatey`.

    If you are installing to another location, you will need to handle this yourself, i.e. restrict write access to Admins in case you so desire.
    This is due to alternative locations could have a range of permissions that should not be changed.
    See <Xref title="Why does Chocolatey install where it does" value="default-chocolatey-install-reasoning" /> and [GitHub Issue 398](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/398) for more details.
</Callout>

### Installing a particular version of Chocolatey

Set the following environment variable prior to install:

* `chocolateyVersion` - controls what version of Chocolatey is installed

In PowerShell, it looks like this:

```powershell
$env:chocolateyVersion = '0.9.9.12'
# install script
```

<Callout type="info">
    This will only work with the installation methods that call https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1 as part of the install.
</Callout>

### Use Windows built-in compression instead of downloading 7zip

Set the following environment variable prior to install:

* `chocolateyUseWindowsCompression` - this will bypass the download and use of 7zip.

In PowerShell, it looks like this:

```powershell
$env:chocolateyUseWindowsCompression = 'true'
# install script
```

<Callout type="info">
    This will only work with the installation methods that call https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1 as part of the install.
</Callout>

### Installing with restricted TLS

<Callout type="info">
    community.chocolatey.org now requires TLS 1.2 at a minimum. Please see https://blog.chocolatey.org/2020/01/remove-support-for-old-tls-versions/.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
    If your server is restricted to TLS 1.1+, you need to add additional logic to be able to download and install Chocolatey (this is not necessary when running Chocolatey normally as it does this automatically).
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
    If this is for organizational use, you should consider hosting the Chocolatey package internally and installing from there.
</Callout>

If you see an error that looks similar to the following:

```powershell
Exception calling "DownloadString" with "1" argument(s): "The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error
occurred on a receive."
At line:1 char:1
+ iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/in ...
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [], MethodInvocationException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : WebException
```

OR:

```powershell
Exception calling "DownloadString" with "1" argument(s): "The request was aborted: Could not create SSL/TLS secure
channel."
At line:1 char:51
+ ... ess -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('ht ...
+                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [], MethodInvocationException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : WebException
```

It's possible that you are attempting to install from a server that needs to use TLS 1.1 or TLS 1.2 (has restricted the use of TLS 1.0 and SSL v3), you have some options. community.chocolatey.org now requires TLS 1.2 at a minimum.

#### Option 1 - Host Internally

If you are an organization, this is your best option and it reduces issues with rate limiting that could occur later.

See https://chocolatey.org/install#organization for details.


#### Option 2 - Updated PowerShell and .NET

Upgrade to the following:

* <Xref title="A supported PowerShell version" value="chocolatey-components-dependencies-and-support-lifecycle" anchor="supported-powershell-versions" />
* .NET Framework 4.5

```powershell
try {
  # Set TLS 1.2 (3072) as that is the minimum required by Chocolatey.org
  # Use integers because the enumeration value for TLS 1.2 won't exist
  # in .NET 4.0, even though they are addressable if .NET 4.5+ is
  # installed (.NET 4.5 is an in-place upgrade).
  [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072
} catch {
  Write-Warning 'Unable to set PowerShell to use TLS 1.2. This is required for contacting Chocolatey as of 03 FEB 2020. https://blog.chocolatey.org/2020/01/remove-support-for-old-tls-versions/. If you see underlying connection closed or trust errors, you may need to do one or more of the following: (1) upgrade to .NET Framework 4.5+ and PowerShell v3+, (2) Call [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = 3072; in PowerShell prior to attempting installation, (3) specify internal Chocolatey package location (set $env:chocolateyDownloadUrl prior to install or host the package internally), (4) use the Download + PowerShell method of install. See https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/setup for all install options.'
}

iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

#### Option 3 - Manual

You need to download and unzip the Chocolatey package, then call the PowerShell install script from there. See the [Install downloaded NuGet package from PowerShell](#install-downloaded-nuget-package-from-powershell) section below.


### Non-Administrative install

<Callout type="info">
    This option should be a last resort and is considered to be a more advanced scenario - most things you do on Windows require administrative rights, especially surrounding software management, so you are going to be limited even in packages you attempt to install. If you are using the [community package repository](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages), there are over 200 packages you can install from the community repository without administrative permission - see https://community.chocolatey.org/packages?q=id%3Aportable+tag%3Aportable.
</Callout>

You must choose a different location than the default (see [Installing to a different location](#installing-to-a-different-location) above). The default is a more secure location that only administrators can update.

1. Save the script below as `ChocolateyInstallNonAdmin.ps1`.
1. Use the script below, determine where you might want Chocolatey installed if it is not to `C:\ProgramData\chocoportable`.
1. Open PowerShell.exe.
1. Run the following `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force;`
1. Run `.\ChocolateyInstallNonAdmin.ps1`.

ChocolateyInstallNonAdmin.ps1:

```powershell
# Set directory for installation - Chocolatey does not lock
# down the directory if not the default
$InstallDir='C:\ProgramData\chocoportable'
$env:ChocolateyInstall="$InstallDir"

# If your PowerShell Execution policy is restrictive, you may
# not be able to get around that. Try setting your session to
# Bypass.
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force;

# All install options - offline, proxy, etc at
# https://chocolatey.org/install
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

Examples of packages you can install:

```powershell
choco install puppet-agent.portable -y
choco install ruby.portable -y
choco install git.commandline -y

# pick an editor
#choco install visualstudiocode.portable -y # not yet available
choco install notepadplusplus.commandline -y
#choco install nano -y
#choco install vim-tux.portable

# What else can I install without admin rights?
# https://community.chocolatey.org/packages?q=id%3Aportable
```
