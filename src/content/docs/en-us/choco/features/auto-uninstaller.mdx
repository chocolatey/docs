<Callout type="warning">
    Chocolatey CLI Automatic Uninstaller is a powerful feature that can result in unexpected results. If you install other software while a package is being installed, Chocolatey CLI will detect these additional installations and will automatically uninstall them for you, when you uninstall the package.

The Automatic Uninstaller feature in Chocolatey CLI looks at the software installed on the computer, before a package is installed, and after a package is installed. Knowing what software has been installed on the computer by a package, allows Chocolatey CLI to automatically uninstall that software when uninstalling the package, without any additional effort.

### How do I skip the Automatic Uninstaller?

If you are trying to uninstall a package, but the Automatic Uninstall feature is uninstalling software you don't want to be uninstalled, then it can be skipped by using the `--skip-autouninstaller` option on the command line. You can <Xref title="disable the feature" value="configuration" anchor="automatic-uninstaller" /> by setting the `autoUninstaller` feature to `false`

If you are <Xref title="creating a package" value="package-creation-guide" />, and want to use the `chocolateyUninstall.ps1` to uninstall software without using the Automatic Uninstaller, include an empty file with the name `.skipAutoUninstall`, inside the package. This will stop the Automatic Uninstaller for that specific package. If a `.skipAutoUninstall` file is being included, make sure that it is included in the `files` element of the `.nuspec`, either explicitly via a `file` element, or by placing the file inside a folder that is included inside the package (like the `tools` directory).
