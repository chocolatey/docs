# Source Command (choco sources)

Chocolatey will allow you to interact with sources.

## Usage

~~~
    choco source [list]|add|remove|disable|enable [<options/switches>]
    choco sources [list]|add|remove|disable|enable [<options/switches>]
~~~


## Examples

~~~
    choco source
    choco source list
    choco source add -n=bob -s="https://somewhere/out/there/api/v2/"
    choco source add -n=bob -s "'https://somewhere/out/there/api/v2/'" -cert=\Users\bob\bob.pfx
    choco source add -n=bob -s "'https://somewhere/out/there/api/v2/'" -u=bob -p=12345
    choco source disable -n=bob
    choco source enable -n=bob
    choco source remove -n=bob
~~~


When it comes to the source location, this can be a folder/file share or an http
location. If it is a url, it will be a location you can go to in a browser and
it returns OData with something that says Packages in the browser, similar to
what you see when you go to https://community.chocolatey.org/api/v2/.

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> See scripting in <Xref title="how to pass arguments" value="choco-commands" anchor="how-to-pass-options-switches" /> (`choco -?`) for how to
 write proper scripts and integrations.


## Exit Codes

Exit codes that normally result from running this command.

Normal:
 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected
 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred
 - 2: nothing to do (enhanced)

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> Starting in v2.3.0, if you have the feature 'useEnhancedExitCodes'
 turned on, then choco will provide enhanced exit codes that allow
 better integration and scripting.

If you find other exit codes that we have not yet documented, please
 file a ticket so we can document it at
 https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new/choose.


## Options and Switches

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are
 running a command like install that allows installing multiple
 packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, it is going to look for and
 try to install version 1.0.0 of every package passed. So please split
 out multiple package calls when wanting to pass specific options.
