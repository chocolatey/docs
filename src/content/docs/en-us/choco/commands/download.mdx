# Download Command (choco download)

### Package Copy / Package Downloader

Chocolatey [Licensed Editions](https://chocolatey.org/compare) only.

Downloads a package from a source and unpacks it.

### Package Internalizer

[Chocolatey for Business](https://chocolatey.org/compare) (C4B) and Managed Service Providers (MSP) only.

Downloads a package from a source, optionally downloading remote
 resources and recompiling the package to use internal resources. This
 takes an existing package and makes it available without any internet
 requirement.

See https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/features/package-internalizer


## Usage

~~~
choco download <pkg> [<options/switches>] [install_script_variable=value]

Install script variables are values that are discovered in the
  chocolateyInstall.ps1 (or a script it calls). When you find values
  there maybe don't get found and replaced or they use a default
  value and you want to provide a value for them to use instead, you
  can find them and then provide the value you want to pass instead.
  For example, in the Firefox package, it uses a default value of
  'en-US' for `$locale`. If you want to change that, you can add
  `locale` and a value, which will replace `$locale` in the script,
  e.g. `choco download firefox --internalize locale=en-GB`.

## Options and Switches

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are
 running a command like install that allows installing multiple
 packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, it is going to look for and
 try to install version 1.0.0 of every package passed. So please split
 out multiple package calls when wanting to pass specific options.
