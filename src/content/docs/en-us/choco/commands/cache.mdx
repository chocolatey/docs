# Cache Command (choco cache)

> :choco-warning: **WARNING**
>
> This command was introduced in Chocolatey CLI v2.1.0

Get the statistics of what Chocolatey CLI has cached or clear any cached
items in the current context.

The behavior of this command will vary depending on whether it is running in an elevated context or not.
Statistics and removing cached items will always happen on the User HTTP Cache.
However, the System HTTP Cache will only be considered if running in an elevated context.

## Usage

~~~
    choco cache [list]|remove [options/switches]
~~~


## Examples

~~~
    choco cache
    choco cache list
    choco cache remove
    choco cache remove --expired
~~~


> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> See scripting in <Xref title="how to pass arguments" value="choco-commands" anchor="how-to-pass-options-switches" /> (`choco -?`) for how to
 write proper scripts and integrations.

## Exit Codes

Exit codes that normally result from running this command.

Normal:
 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected
 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred

If you find other exit codes that we have not yet documented, please
 file a ticket so we can document it at
 https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new/choose.


## Options and Switches

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are
 running a command like install that allows installing multiple
 packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, it is going to look for and
 try to install version 1.0.0 of every package passed. So please split
 out multiple package calls when wanting to pass specific options.

Includes <Xref title="default options/switches" value="choco-commands" anchor="default-options-and-switches" /> (included below for completeness).
