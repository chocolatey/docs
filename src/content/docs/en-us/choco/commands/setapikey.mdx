# ApiKey Command (choco setapikey)

This lists API keys that are set or sets an api key for a particular
 source so it doesn't need to be specified every time.

Anything that doesn't contain source and key will list API keys.

## Usage

~~~
    choco apikey [<options/switches>]
    choco setapikey [<options/switches>]
~~~


## Examples

~~~
    choco apikey
    choco apikey -s https://somewhere/out/there
    choco apikey list
    choco apikey list -s https://somewhere/out/there
    choco apikey add -s="https://somewhere/out/there/" -k="value"
    choco apikey add -s "https://push.chocolatey.org/" -k="123-123123-123"
    choco apikey add -s "http://internal_nexus" -k="user:password"
    choco apikey remove -s https://somewhere/out/there
~~~


For source location, this can be a folder/file share or an
http location. When it comes to urls, they can be different from the packages
url (where packages are searched and installed from). As an example, for
Chocolatey's community package package repository, the package url is
https://community.chocolatey.org/api/v2/, but the push url is https://push.chocolatey.org
(and the deprecated https://chocolatey.org/ as a push url). Check the
documentation for your choice of repository to learn what the push url is.

For the key, this can be an apikey that is provided by your source repository.
With some sources, like Nexus, this can be a NuGet API key or it could be a
user name and password specified as 'user:password' for the API key. Please see
your repository's documentation (for Nexus, please see
https://ch0.co/nexus2apikey).

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> See scripting in <Xref title="how to pass arguments" value="choco-commands" anchor="how-to-pass-options-switches" /> (`choco -?`) for how to
 write proper scripts and integrations.


## Connecting to Chocolatey.org (Community Package Repository)

In order to save your API key for https://push.chocolatey.org/,
 log in (or register, confirm and then log in) to
 https://push.chocolatey.org/, go to https://push.chocolatey.org/account,
 copy the API Key, and then use it in the following command:

~~~
    choco apikey add -k <your key here> -s https://push.chocolatey.org/
~~~



## Exit Codes

Exit codes that normally result from running this command.

Normal:
 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected
 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred
 - 2: nothing to do, apikey already set (enhanced)

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> Starting in v2.3.0, if you have the feature 'useEnhancedExitCodes'
 turned on, then choco will provide enhanced exit codes that allow
 better integration and scripting.

If you find other exit codes that we have not yet documented, please
 file a ticket so we can document it at
 https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new/choose.


## Options and Switches

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are
 running a command like install that allows installing multiple
 packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, it is going to look for and
 try to install version 1.0.0 of every package passed. So please split
 out multiple package calls when wanting to pass specific options.
