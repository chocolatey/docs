> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> See scripting in <Xref title="how to pass arguments" value="choco-commands" anchor="how-to-pass-options-switches" /> (`choco -?`) for how to
 write proper scripts and integrations.


## Exit Codes

Exit codes that normally result from running this command.

Normal:

 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred

Enhanced:
 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected
 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> If you have the feature 'useEnhancedExitCodes' turned on,
 then choco will provide enhanced exit codes that allow
 better integration and scripting.

If you find other exit codes that we have not yet documented, please
 file a ticket so we can document it at
 https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new/choose.


## Options and Switches

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are
 running a command like install that allows installing multiple
 packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, it is going to look for and
 try to install version 1.0.0 of every package passed. So please split
 out multiple package calls when wanting to pass specific options.
