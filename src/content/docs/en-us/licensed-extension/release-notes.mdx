### Breaking Change

  - To take advantage of internal changes made in Chocolatey CLI v1.2.0 we have taken a minimum dependency on this version as it changes internally how we are resolving the Chocolatey Licensed Extension.

### Bug Fixes

## 4.2.0 (June 22, 2022) \{#june-22-2022}

### Features

- Intune - Add `--skip-cleanup` option to push command.
  - When pushing a package to Intune, if it fails for any reason Chocolatey CLI will default to removing the partially created application. This new option allows skipping this cleanup process so you can investigate the state in Intune. This option also prevents cleanup of temporary files used for the upload process.

### Bug Fixes

- Fix - Intune - Unable to push package from file directory with spaces - see [licensed #310](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-licensed-issues/issues/310).
- Fix - VirusTotal - Allow business trial license access to VirusTotal virusScannerType - see [licensed #309](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-licensed-issues/issues/309).
  - Business trial customers will now be able to use the VirusTotal scanner type when installing and downloading packages. Previously this feature was limited to just Business and Professional license customers.
- Fix - 7z.exe error causes Chocolatey CLI to throw wrong message - see [licensed #307](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-licensed-issues/issues/307).

- Fix - Package Builder - MSI installer causes package to be built recursively until the path becomes too long.

- Fix - Adding the Chocolatey licensed source without authentication stops Chocolatey CLI from working - see [licensed #279](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-licensed-issues/issues/279).

### Improvements

- Intune:
  - Update `chocolatey.extension` package on Intune tenant to new chocolatey-license package on push.
    - When a new `chocolatey-license` is pushed to Intune, we now automatically link the Chocolatey Licensed Extension to the new dependency.
  - Make `chocolatey.extension` package take exact version dependency on `chocolatey-license` package.
    - The internal structure of the Chocolatey Licensed Extension package identifies requiring the exact license version number.
  - Use 4th part of the version when creating a `chocolatey-license` package to define the node count.
    - When a new license package is created, the node count is included in the version number so updated license counts will correctly update in Intune.
  - Update Package Uploader UI to accept intunewin files for pushing to Intune.
    - Package Uploader UI can now handle intunewin files and pushing to Intune if your license allows it.
- VirusTotal - 500MB+ binaries should not attempt virus scanning since this is not supported by VirusTotal - see [licensed #65](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-licensed-issues/issues/65).
- Package Internalizer - Remove duplicate resources that are downloaded to reduce package size - see [licensed #93](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-licensed-issues/issues/93).

## 4.1.0 (March 30, 2022) \{#march-30-2022}

### Features

- Add feature <Xref title="`excludeChocolateyPackagesDuringUpgradeAll`" value="configuration" anchor="general-2" /> to allow exclusion of all Chocolatey component packages during choco upgrade all command.
  - This is designed to prevent unexpected updating of a Chocolatey component when executing the `choco upgrade all` command. Chocolatey has had the `upgradeAllExceptions` configuration
    option since v0.10.14, where any package can be excluded from the `choco upgrade all` command, however, this feature makes it really simple to add all the official Chocolatey
    component packages into this exclusion list.
- Add an attribute to the Chocolatey Licensed Extension assembly to provide information about the minimum supported Chocolatey version.
  - This will match the version number that is defined in the nuspec dependencies for the chocolatey.extension package, however, this assembly attribute is something which can be
    checked at the time of running choco.exe to allow checks to see if everything is compatible.

    When using Chocolatey Licensed Extension, the order of upgrading packages is very important!

  - Given the [changes](https://blog.chocolatey.org/2021/09/chocolatey-licensed-changes-restricted-to-licensed-nodes/) that are included in this release, this option is no longer supported. Packages that are intended to be published to the Chocolatey Community Repository should be created without using any commercial arguments to the Chocolatey CLI.

### Features

- Microsoft Intune Integration - Using Chocolatey Licensed Extension now supports converting/pushing of Chocolatey packages to Intune - more information can be found in the [docs](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/licensed-extension/intune/).

### Bug Fixes

- Fix - PowerShell: Set destination parameter for `Get-ChocolateyUnzip` to be required - to match what is used in Chocolatey CLI.

</Callout>

A few nice things going into this release with Package Reducer/Optimize coming out of preview, Package Internalizer allowing you to specify variable overrides

### Breaking Change

- Package Reducer is now on by default.

When we first released package reducer, it was in a preview mode to allow for folks to opt in to test it and find issues. Now we are turning it on by default. If you should experience issues with it, please contact support to file an issue (provide a zipped log as well). To turn it off should you not want to use it, you can just run `choco feature disable --name=reduceInstalledPackageSpaceUsage`.

### Bug Fixes

- Self-Service / Background Mode:
  - Fix - Work with empty sessions. Self-service users were incorrectly bypassing background service when their active session doesn't have a name, which has become common with Windows 10.
  - Fix - Allow self-service to work when the current working directory is different from system drive or a mapped drive. Also allow it to be set to locations where any user would not have a permissions error.
- Package Internalizer (`choco download`):
  - Fix - When a variable is set to the contents of a file, work with that appropriately. A good example of this is `$data` variable in [dotnetcore-runtime](https://github.com/dotnetcore-chocolatey/dotnetcore-chocolateypackages/blob/d5960c11dda388cc7f7ab6438eee8984774f7662/dotnetcore-runtime.install/tools/ChocolateyInstall.ps1#L4) package.
  - Fix - Allow setting variable when there is a comment on the same line following the set. An example of this is in the [Firefox](https://github.com/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-packages/blob/91f4e51f5c8503ca962c22a2f087b96d22ae0e9f/automatic/firefox/tools/chocolateyInstall.ps1#L26) package.
- Package Builder (`choco new`):
  - Fix - Package Builder UI should recognize Architect and MSP editions and correctly set the UI for use with them.
  - Fix - Extract icon from the proper location for the file.

### Improvements

- Package Internalizer (`choco download`):
  - Override variables in the installation script. When you see something like `$locale` being set and you want to override it to your own value for internalization, you can pass that variable name and value as a key value pair. As an example, try `choco download thunderbird --internalize locale=en-US` versus `choco download thunderbird --internalize locale=es-ES`.
- Package Reducer - `choco optimize` command out of preview.
- Package Builder (`choco new`):
  - Extract icons from MSIs as well.
  - Package Builder UI logo animation should match chocolatey website.

## 1.12.10 (December 18, 2017) \{#december-18-2017}

### Feature

- Run background service interactively - sometimes you install applications that are unattended but cannot be silent.

If you want self-service to interactively manage installations, run `choco feature enable --name=useBackgroundServiceInteractively`. This requires that you use the `ChocolateyLocalAdmin` account with the Chocolatey-managed password as passwords are not stored and the service would need to produce that at runtime. There are some security considerations and why this is not turned on by default. Please see [interactive self-service consideration](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/agent/setup#interactive-self-service-consideration).

### Bug Fixes

- Windows Service Management Functions:
  - Fix - Adding user to Administrators no longer fails with "Network path was not found" when there are domain users and local users in the administrators group.
- Package Builder (`choco new`):
  - Fix - Create packages from non-admin (instead of access denied error).
  - Fix - Don't attempt to generate an icon unless a file for that icon exists.

### Improvements

- Package Builder (`choco new`):
  - Right click create package w/out GUI should pause on error. This allows a user to see any errors instead of closing quickly.
  - Do not generate template files if not using the default template.

## 1.12.9 (November 10, 2017) \{#november-10-2017}

### Bug Fixes

- Package Internalizer (`choco download`):
  - Pass multiple package names to download/internalize (`choco download pkg1 pkg2 pkgN`).
  - Downloaded resources will use download CDN cache if available.
- Windows Service Management Functions:
  - Allow upgrading services without a restart - pass `-DoNotReinstallService` to `Install-ChocolateyWindowsService`.

## 1.12.0 (July 10, 2017) \{#july-10-2017}

### Features

- Package Reducer / Optimize (All licensed editions) - Reduce Space Usage for Chocolatey Installations.

    If you have a significant number of Chocolatey packages you manage, you may notice that you also may have a pretty significant space usage under the Chocolatey lib directory. Package reducer automatically decreases the size of nupkg files to around 5KB and removes installers and zips automatically from your package install directories. This may allow you to save GBs of usage for a large amount of packages being managed.

    To learn more about Package Reducer and `choco optimize`, please see https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/features/package-reducer.

- Package Audit (C4B) - Learn Who and When.

    Reporting is very important, and auditing not only when your installations occurred but who installed them can be critical. There is nothing that presents this kind of information as easily as you will be able to gather it with Chocolatey for Business (C4B) and Package Audit.

    To learn more about Package Audit, please see https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/features/package-audit.

### Improvements

- Package Internalizer (`choco download`):
  - Option (`--internalize-all-urls`) to internalize any url in a package (not just if the package scripts contain known-compatible known functions).

  - Added `useBackgroundServiceWithNonAdministratorsOnly` feature switch to skip background mode for administrators.
- Windows Service Management Functions:
  - Added `useLocalSystemForServiceInstalls` feature switch to disable using LocalSystem as the user for services by default.
  - Added config settings to provide local user / password.
  - If the password is empty or not provided, Chocolatey will manage the password securely.
  - If the user doesn't exist, the account will be created.
  - Accounts are ensured to be administrators.
  - Accounts are ensured to have Log on as service and batch rights.

## 1.11.0 (June 27, 2017) \{#june-27-2017}

### Bug Fixes

- Self-Service / Background Mode
  - Fix - Use a URI with WCF named pipes that doesn't exclusively hold a lock on the root (blocking other services). Fallback to old URI for versions of chocolatey-agent less than 0.7.0+. - see [#12](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-licensed-issues/issues/12).
  - Fix - Ensure chocolatey.lib can send arguments through and not just choco.exe.

### Improvement

- Package Synchronizer - update registry links when software updates.

## 1.10.0 (June 9, 2017) \{#june-9-2017}

This release brings Package Throttle, Package Synchronizer's "Show All Packages in Programs and Features", and Direct Installer (aka Package-less Install) to Chocolatey. There are also numerous improvements to Package Builder, fixes and improvements to Package Internalizer and Self-Service. Package Throttle is in all licensed editions, allowing Pro, MSP, and C4B customers the ability to slow down Chocolatey as it downloads packages and any resources the packages are downloading. See more details each section below.

### Breaking Changes

- [Security] Self-Service / Background Mode - support background mode with self-service sources only by default.

    If you are using self-service functionality, when you upgrade to v1.10, you will need to go to those sources that you allow to be self-service and ensure they are selected to allow self-service (`choco source list`). Otherwise by default users are going to be locked out of using those sources. The move to opt-in is best from a security standpoint and we want to give you the ability to have folks opt-in to the better behavior.

    To change this behavior back to the way it was previously, simply run `choco disable --name useBackgroundServiceWithSelfServiceSourcesOnly`. For more details see `choco feature list` or https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/configuration#self-service-background-mode

### Features

- Package Throttle - Throttle Bandwidth / Rate Limit Download Speeds.

    By default, Chocolatey downloads packages and resources as fast as it can. Package Throttle gives you a way to slow down Chocolatey so it doesn't overwhelm any bandwidth restrictions you may have. This is done as both a setting and per package install/upgrade. This is in bits per second (not bytes, bits is what most network traffic is measured in). When adding at runtime, simply add `--bps=VALUE`. To set the value in the configuration, call `choco config set --name maximumDownloadRateBitsPerSecond --value VALUE`. For more details see https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/features/package-reducer.

- Package Synchronizer's Show All Packages In Programs and Features.

    This means packages that do not have an underlying installation can still show up in Programs and Features and be managed there as well, which allows for legacy inventory reporting systems to see all the software that is installed in the same way that Chocolatey is able to. A picture can probably best explain this feature, check out [All Package In Programs and Features](/images/features/features_packages_in_programs_and_features.png)

    To turn this feature on, simply run the following command `choco feature enable --name showAllPackagesInProgramsAndFeatures`. For more details on the feature, see https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/configuration#package-synchronizer and https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/features/package-synchronization. This does require one additional run of `choco` to take affect (same when disabling the feature), hopefully we can remove that in the future.

- Package-less Install / Direct Installer - Install and upgrade directly from installers (MSIs, EXEs, etc)!

    If Package Builder can create a fully unattended package for an installer, you don't even need a package first. You can simply call `choco install nameoffile.msi` or `choco upgrade nameoffile.exe` and Chocolatey will generate packaging on the fly and install/upgrade the package!

### Bug Fixes

- Fix - `choco new` generates uninstall template with wrong use of registry key variable - see [#1304](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1304).
- Package Internalizer (`choco download`):
  - Fix - Append `UseOriginalLocation` for multiline so that it adds a continuation and not a hanging parameter on a new line.
  - Fix - Variable replacement wasn't working for `${value}` and `$($value)`.
  - Fix - Find and replace the original url in the script.

### Improvements

- [Security] Allow locking down new/download commands to admin only - added as feature flip switches (see `choco feature list`).
- Self-Service / Background Mode:
  - Provide the user context to Chocolatey CLI on install / upgrade (user context is original user requesting action).
- Package Builder (`choco new`):
  - Find MSI Properties in CustomActions and in Properties table listed in Properties ending in "Properties".
  - Show possible silent options when installer type is not determinable or is found to be custom.
  - General template improvements.
- Package Internalizer (`choco download`):
  - Rewrite any scripts that `chocolateyInstall.ps1` uses into the `chocolateyInstall.ps1` file.

## 1.9.8 (March 25, 2017) \{#march-25-2017}

### Bug Fixes

- Fix - Ensure Chocolatey Licensed is compatible with Chocolatey v0.10.4.

- Fix - Package Builder - Restrict `Get-UninstallRegistryKey` params in `chocolateyUninstall.ps1`.
- Fix - Package Internalizer - exit non-zero when variable replacement fails.

- Install Directory should see `INSTALLFOLDER` MSI Property.
- Virus Scanner - provide context for other answers (No/Skip).
- Allow both 32bit and 64bit file parameters with `Install-ChocolateyInstallPackage` - see [#1187](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1187).

## 1.9.0 (January 15, 2017) \{#january-15-2017}

This release brings the coveted PackageBuilder UI to the Pro+ license (minus auto detection) and adds a tabbed interface that allows you to fill out the entire nuspec. Package Synchronizer now has `choco sync` to compliment the automatic synchronization. The sync command brings all unmanaged software in Programs and Features under Chocolatey management.

### Features

- Support Self-Service Install / Background Mode - see the [documentation](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/features/self-service-anywhere).
- Manage Windows Services.

We've introduced some service management functions to the business edition. `Install-ChocolateyWindowsService`, `Uninstall-ChocolateyWindowsService`, `Start-ChocolateyWindowsService`, and `Stop-ChocolateyWindowsService`. Those will be documented soon enough. For now some example code should suffice.

```powershell
$toolsDir   = "$(Split-Path -parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Definition)"
$serviceExe = Join-Path $toolsDir 'service\chocolatey-agent.exe'

$packageArgs = @{
  Name                  = 'chocolatey-agent'
  DisplayName           = 'Chocolatey Agent'
  Description           = 'Chocolatey Agent is a background service for Chocolatey.'
  StartupType           = 'Automatic'
  ServiceExecutablePath = $serviceExe
}

#Username, Password, -DoNotStartService are also considered

Install-ChocolateyWindowsService @packageArgs

# The other three methods simply take the service name.
Start-ChocolateyWindowsService -Name 'chocolatey-agent'
Stop-ChocolateyWindowsService -Name 'chocolatey-agent'
Uninstall-ChocolateyWindowsService -Name 'chocolatey-agent'
```

## 1.8.0 (November 16, 2016) \{#november-16-2016}

Package Builder has some major improvements in this release, including a new UI! See https://blog.chocolatey.org/2016/11/package-builder-announcements/ for details! While building some of the features for the enhancements for this release, we've made quite a few tweaks and fixes to Package Builder and we think you are going to like the results. Being able to generate packages from the installed software on a reference system is huge (`choco new --from-programs-and-features`)!

Pro users now have the ability to download packages (minus internalization). This is fantastic if you want to pull down a lot of packages quickly from a remote source. Or pull down packages and push them up to an internal source.

### Features

- Package Downloader comes to Pro+ Licenses - minus internalizer, you can now download a package using an easy command `choco download`.
- Package Builder (`choco new`):
  - Package Builder now has a UI - see https://youtu.be/qJNKR_PEQqY for details.
  - Right click on an exe, msi, zip (or other supported types) and click "Create Package...".
  - Package Builder - generate packages from installed software (Programs and Features) - see https://youtu.be/Mw_ReipnskI for details.

### Bug Fixes

- Package Builder (`choco new`):
  - Fix - silent arguments for MSU/MSP should not include the file itself.
  - Fix - remove comma if found.
  - Fix - remove trailing period.
  - Fix - Remove the entire word surrounding a version.
- Package Internalizer (`choco download`):
  - Fix - mixed line endings were causing "Index was outside the bounds of the array" errors.
- Package Synchronizer:
  - Fix - sync location should not be in the extensions folder, causes extension loading issues - a similar fix will be in open source to ignore the old sync location in v0.10.4 (see [#1041](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1041)).
  - Fix - sync over an existing synced package without error.

### Improvements

- Uninstall - Uninstall software not managed with Chocolatey. Use something like `choco uninstall 7-zip* --from-programs-and-features` to ensure removal from Programs and Features directly. Also requires Chocolatey v0.10.4.
- VirusTotal - When a user cancels a virus check, set the proper exit code so that rollback occurs automatically - see [#985](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/985).
- Package Builder (`choco new`):
  - Return a TODO list when there are more things to do to finish packaging.
  - Set values to replace if they are not set.
  - Use company name for nuspec copyright if copyright is not available.
  - Provide more verbose logging when necessary.
  - Remove more installer wording - "setup", "remove only".
  - If we exhaust all other options for determining name and version, use the file name and split version from name.
  - Add or remove architecture from the package id - `choco new --include-architecture-in-name` and `choco new --remove-architecture-from-name`, respectively.
- Package Synchronizer:
  -Synchronize to a new location per package version.

## 1.7.0 (Sep 22, 2016) \{#sep-22-2016}

### Bug Fixes

- Package Builder (`choco new`) - Removed `fileFullPath` from install template - add back in when local zip only. Fixes an error as `file` and `fileFullPath` are aliases starting in 0.10.1.
- Package Internalizer (`choco download`) - ensure logging does not incur log format exceptions
- install/upgrade - Look for downloaded file at old path if replaced 'chocolatey\chocolatey' path does not exist - see [#969](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/969)

### Improvements

- Package Builder (`choco new`):
  - `--build-package` to build a package after Package Builder creates the package all in one go.
  - `--pause-on-error` to pause the output when there are errors for closer inspection (useful when run from a batch file).
  - Specify checksum and type - checksum will be verified against files/downloaded files.
  - Loads of improvements in how package id and title are determined and cleaned up.
  - Product versions and portions of product versions are removed from package id/title.
- Package Internalizer (`choco download`):
  - Add `--internalize` as alias to `--recompile`.
  - Warn of issue with `-UseOriginalLocation` when only using one file.
  - Add `--append-useoriginallocation` and feature internalizeAppendUseOriginalLocation that makes the determination to add to the end of `Install-ChocolateyPackage` when using local resources.

## 1.4.1 (June 14, 2016) \{#june-14-2016}

### Bug Fix

- PowerShell v2 assembly was not loading. There was a dependency on an incorrect version of PowerShell assemblies, causing it to only attempt to load System.Management.Automation v3 and above - [#799](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/799).

## 1.4.0 (June 13, 2016) \{#june-13-2016}

### Features

### Features

- Ubiquitous Install Directory Switch! When working with properly formed packages that use Install-ChocolateyPackage (or Install-ChocolateyInstallPackage), Chocolatey is able to override the native installer's directory from one single option you provide to Chocolatey. You no longer need to know what the installer type is and provide that through install arguments. See `choco install -?` and `--install-directory` option for details.
- Generic Virus Scanner - for organizations that don't want to run checks using VirusTotal, we've provided a way for organizations to use their own virus scanner. See `choco config list` for details.
