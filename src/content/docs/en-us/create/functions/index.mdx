# PowerShell Functions aka Helpers Reference

{/* This documentation file is automatically generated from the files at $sourceFunctions using $($sourceLocation)GenerateDocs.ps1. Contributions are welcome at the original location(s). */}

## Summary

In your Chocolatey packaging, you have the ability to use these functions (and others with Chocolatey's <Xref title="PowerShell Extensions" value="extensions" />) to work with all aspects of software management. Keep in mind Chocolatey's automation scripts are just PowerShell, so you can do manage anything you want.

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> These scripts are for package scripts, not for use directly in PowerShell. This is in the create packages section, not the using Chocolatey section.

## Main Functions

These functions call other functions and many times may be the only thing you need in your <Xref title="chocolateyInstall.ps1 file" value="chocolatey-install-ps1" />.

* <Xref title="Install-ChocolateyPackage" value="install-chocolateypackage" />
* <Xref title="Install-ChocolateyZipPackage" value="install-chocolateyzippackage" />
* <Xref title="Install-ChocolateyPowershellCommand" value="install-chocolateypowershellcommand" />
* <Xref title="Install-ChocolateyVsixPackage" value="install-chocolateyvsixpackage" />

## More Functions

### Administrative Access Functions

When creating packages that need to run one of the following commands below, one should add the tag `admin` to the nuspec.

* <Xref title="Install-ChocolateyPackage" value="install-chocolateypackage" />
* <Xref title="Start-ChocolateyProcessAsAdmin" value="start-chocolateyprocessasadmin" />

## Variables

There are also a number of environment variables providing access to some values from the nuspec and other information that may be useful. They are accessed via `$env:variableName`.

### Environment Variables

Chocolatey makes a number of environment variables available (You can access any of these with $env:TheVariableNameBelow):

* TEMP/TMP - Overridden to the CacheLocation, but may be the same as the original TEMP folder
* ChocolateyInstall - Top level folder where Chocolatey is installed
* ChocolateyPackageName - The name of the package, equivalent to the `<id />` field in the nuspec
* ChocolateyPackageTitle - The title of the package, equivalent to the `<title />` field in the nuspec
* ChocolateyPackageVersion - The version of the package, equivalent to the `<version />` field in the nuspec

#### Advanced Environment Variables

The following are more advanced settings:

* ChocolateyPackageParameters - Parameters to use with packaging, not the same as install arguments (which are passed directly to the native installer). Based on `--package-parameters`.
* CHOCOLATEY_VERSION - The version of Choco you normally see. Use if you are 'lighting' things up based on choco version, otherwise take a dependency on the specific version you need.
* ChocolateyForceX86 = If available and set to 'true', then user has requested 32bit version. Automatically handled in built in Choco functions.
* OS_PLATFORM - Like Windows, macOS, Linux.
* OS_VERSION - The version of OS, like 6.1 something something for Windows.
* OS_NAME - The reported name of the OS.
* IS_PROCESSELEVATED = Is the process elevated?
* ChocolateyPackageInstallLocation - Install location of the software that the package installs. Displayed at the end of the package install.

#### Set By Options and Configuration

Some environment variables are set based on options that are passed, configuration and/or features that are turned on:

 * ChocolateyEnvironmentDebug - Was `--debug` passed? If using the built-in PowerShell host, this is always true (but only logs debug messages to console if `--debug` was passed)
 * ChocolateyEnvironmentVerbose - Was `--verbose` passed? If using the built-in PowerShell host, this is always true (but only logs verbose messages to console if `--verbose` was passed).
 * ChocolateyForce - Was `--force` passed?
 * ChocolateyForceX86 - Was `-x86` passed?
 * ChocolateyRequestTimeout - How long before a web request will time out. Set by config `webRequestTimeoutSeconds`
 * ChocolateyResponseTimeout - How long to wait for a download to complete? Set by config `commandExecutionTimeoutSeconds`
 * ChocolateyPowerShellHost - Are we using the built-in PowerShell host? Set by `--use-system-powershell` or the feature `powershellHost`

#### Business Edition Variables

 * ChocolateyInstallArgumentsSensitive - Encrypted arguments passed from command line `--install-arguments-sensitive` that are not logged anywhere.
 * ChocolateyPackageParametersSensitive - Package parameters passed from command line `--package-parameters-sensitive` that are not logged anywhere.
 * ChocolateyLicensedVersion - What version is the licensed edition on?
 * ChocolateyLicenseType - What edition / type of the licensed edition is installed?

#### Experimental Environment Variables

The following are experimental or use not recommended:

 * OS_IS64BIT = This may not return correctly - it may depend on the process the app is running under
 * CHOCOLATEY_VERSION_PRODUCT = the version of Choco that may match CHOCOLATEY_VERSION but may be different - based on git describe
 * IS_ADMIN = Is the user an administrator? But doesn't tell you if the process is elevated.

#### Not Useful Or Anti-Pattern If Used

 * ChocolateyInstallOverride - Not for use in package automation scripts. Based on `--override-arguments` being passed.
 * ChocolateyInstallArguments - The installer arguments meant for the native installer. You should use chocolateyPackageParameters instead. Based on `--install-arguments` being passed.
 * ChocolateyIgnoreChecksums - Was `--ignore-checksums` passed or the feature `checksumFiles` turned off?
 * ChocolateyAllowEmptyChecksums - Was `--allow-empty-checksums` passed or the feature `allowEmptyChecksums` turned on?
 * ChocolateyAllowEmptyChecksumsSecure - Was `--allow-empty-checksums-secure` passed or the feature `allowEmptyChecksumsSecure` turned on?
 * ChocolateyChecksum32 - Was `--download-checksum` passed?
 * ChocolateyChecksumType32 - Was `--download-checksum-type` passed?
 * ChocolateyChecksum64 - Was `--download-checksum-x64` passed?
 * ChocolateyChecksumType64 - Was `--download-checksum-type-x64` passed?
 * ChocolateyPackageExitCode - The exit code of the script that just ran - usually set by `Set-PowerShellExitCode`
 * ChocolateyLastPathUpdate - Set by Chocolatey as part of install, but not used for anything in particular in packaging.
 * ChocolateyProxyLocation - The explicit proxy location as set in the configuration `proxy`
 * ChocolateyDownloadCache - Use available download cache? Set by `--skip-download-cache`, `--use-download-cache`, or feature `downloadCache`
 * ChocolateyProxyBypassList - Explicitly set locations to ignore in configuration `proxyBypassList`
 * ChocolateyProxyBypassOnLocal - Should the proxy bypass on local connections? Set based on configuration `proxyBypassOnLocal`
 * http_proxy - Set by original `http_proxy` passthrough, or same as `ChocolateyProxyLocation` if explicitly set.
 * https_proxy - Set by original `https_proxy` passthrough, or same as `ChocolateyProxyLocation` if explicitly set.
 * no_proxy- Set by original `no_proxy` passthrough, or same as `ChocolateyProxyBypassList` if explicitly set.
 * ChocolateyPackageFolder - Not for use in package automation scripts. Recommend using `$toolsDir = "$(Split-Path -parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Definition)"` as per template generated by `choco new`
 * ChocolateyToolsLocation - Not for use in package automation scripts. Recommend using Get-ToolsLocation instead
