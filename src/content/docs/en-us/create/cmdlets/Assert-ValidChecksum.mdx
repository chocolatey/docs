# Assert-ValidChecksum

## SYNOPSIS
Checks a file's checksum versus a passed checksum and checksum type.

## SYNTAX

```
Assert-ValidChecksum [-Path] <String> [[-Checksum] <String>] [[-ChecksumType] <ChecksumType>] [[-Url] <String>]
 [-IgnoredArguments <Object[]>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

Makes a determination if a file meets an expected checksum signature.
This function is usually used when comparing a file that is downloaded from an official distribution point.
If the checksum fails to match the expected output, this function throws an error.

Checksums have been used for years as a means of verification. A checksum hash is a unique value or signature that corresponds to the contents of a file.
File names and extensions can be altered without changing the checksum signature.
However if you changed the contents of the file, even one character, the checksum will be different.

Checksums are used to provide as a means of cryptographically ensuring the contents of a file have not been changed.
While some cryptographic algorithms, including MD5 and SHA1, are no longer considered secure against attack, the goal of a checksum algorithm is to make it extremely difficult (near impossible with better algorithms) to alter the contents of a file (whether by accident or for malicious reasons) and still result in the same checksum signature.

When verifying a checksum using a secure algorithm, if the checksum matches the expected signature, the contents of the file are identical to what is expected.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
PS C:\> Assert-ValidChecksum -Path $fileFullPath -Checksum $checksum -ChecksumType $checksumType
```

Calculates the `$checksumType` checksum of the file at `$fileFullPath` and compares it to the provided `$checksum` value.
If the checksums do not match, or the `checksum.exe` is missing, this will throw an error.

## PARAMETERS

### -Checksum
The checksum value that the file is expected to match.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ChecksumType
The type of checksum algorithm to use.

```yaml
Type: ChecksumType
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Accepted values: Md5, Sha1, Sha256, Sha512

Required: False
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -IgnoredArguments
Allows splatting with arguments that do not apply. Do not use directly.

```yaml
Type: Object[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Path
The path to the file to verify the checksum for.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: File, FilePath

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Url
The original URL that the file was downloaded from, if any.
This is primarily for internal use, and will only matter if certain Chocolatey CLI features are enabled and there is no `-Checksum` value provided.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: OriginalUrl

Required: False
Position: 3
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see [about_CommonParameters](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

## OUTPUTS

## NOTES
This uses the checksum.exe tool available separately at https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/checksum.

Chocolatey CLI options that affect checksum verification:

- `--ignore-checksums` - skips checksumming
- `--allow-empty-checksums` - skips checksumming when the package is missing a checksum
- `--allow-empty-checksums-secure` - skips checksumming when the package is missing a checksum for secure (HTTPS) locations
- `--require-checksums` - requires checksums for both non-secure and secure locations
- `--download-checksum`, `--download-checksum-type` - allows user to pass their own checksums
- `--download-checksum-x64`, `--download-checksum-type-x64` - allows user to pass their own checksums

Chocolatey CLI features that affect checksum verification:

- `checksumFiles` - when turned off, skips checksumming
- `allowEmptyChecksums` - when turned on, skips checksumming when the package is missing a checksum
- `allowEmptyChecksumsSecure` - when turned on, skips checksumming when the package is missing a checksum for secure (HTTPS) locations

This command is also aliased to `Get-ChecksumValid` for compatibility with packages designed for Chocolatey CLI v2.x and earlier.
