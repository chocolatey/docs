## Where is the Chocolatey Package Path?

The Chocolatey package path is located at `$env:ChocolateyInstall\lib\<PACKAGENAME>` where:

- `$env:ChocolateyInstall` is the value of the `ChocolateyInstall` PowerShell environment variable (by default this is `C:\ProgramData\chocolatey`).
- `<PACKAGENAME>` is the ID of the package you are installing.

## How Do I Restrict What Versions of Windows a Package Will Install On

If the package is installing software that is only supported on a specific version of Windows, you need to **throw a terminating error** which Chocolatey CLI will detect and indicate a package installation failure. In PowerShell, you can create throw an exception using [`throw`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_throw?view=powershell-5.1).

There are a very small number of packages where this rule will not apply: packages, such as Windows KB's, that are used as dependencies and need to be installed even if they do not install anything. If the package failed, and it was a dependency of another package, it may cause issues for the parent package.
