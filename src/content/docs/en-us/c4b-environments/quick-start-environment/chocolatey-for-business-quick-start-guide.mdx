Welcome to the Chocolatey for Business (C4B) Quick-Start Guide! This guide will walk you through the basics of configuring a C4B Server on your VM infrastructure of choice. This includes the Chocolatey Licensed components, a NuGet V2 Repository (Nexus), Chocolatey Central Management (CCM), and an Automation Pipeline (Jenkins).

<Callout type="info">
    This quick-start guide is intended for customers who have recently purchased Chocolatey for Business (C4B), or are evaluating C4B as part of a proof-of-concept.
    It is **opinionated**, and thus illustrates only one method of setting up your Chocolatey environment.
    Our goal is to get you up-and-running smoothly and efficiently in order to fully test out the feature set.
    For a more exhaustive reference of possible setup scenarios, you may refer to the <Xref title="Organizational Deployment Documentation" value="organizational-deployment-guide" />.
</Callout>

If you have any questions or would like to discuss more involved implementations, please feel free to reach out to your Chocolatey representative.

Let's get started!

## Components

<img class="mb-3" src="/images/c4b-server.png" alt="Chocolatey for Business Server Components" width="600"/>

As illustrated in the diagram above, there are four main components to a Chocolatey for Business installation:

1. **C4B Licensed components**: A licensed version of Chocolatey includes:
    - Installation of the Chocolatey OSS client package itself (`chocolatey`)
    - Chocolatey license file (`chocolatey.license.xml`) installed in the correct directory (`ProgramData\chocolatey\license`)
    - Installation of the Chocolatey Licensed extension (`chocolatey.extension`), giving you access to features like Package Builder, Package Internalizer, etc. (full list [here](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/features/)).
    <p></p>

1. **NuGet V3 Repository Server App (Nexus)**: Chocolatey works best with a NuGet V3 repository. This application hosts and manages versioning of your Chocolatey package artifacts, in their enhanced NuGet package (.nupkg) file format. The quick start guide helps you setup [Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager (OSS)](https://www.sonatype.com/products/nexus-repository).

1. **Chocolatey Central Management (CCM)**: CCM is the Web UI portal for your entire Chocolatey environment. Your endpoints check-in to CCM to report their package status. This includes the Chocolatey packages they have installed, and whether any of these packages are outdated. And now, with CCM Deployments, you can also deploy packages or package updates to groups of endpoints, as well as ad-hoc PowerShell commands. CCM is backed by an MS SQL Database. This guide will set up MS SQL Express for you.

1. **Automation Pipeline (Jenkins)**: A pipeline tool will help you automate repetitive tasks, such checking for updates to a set of Chocolatey Packages from the Chocolatey Community Repository (CCR). If updates exist, the pipeline task will auto-internalize your list of packages, and push them into your NuGet repository for you. This guide will help you set up Jenkins as your automation pipeline.

## Requirements

export const callout1 = {
    title: 'ATTENTION',
    type: 'danger'
};

<Callout content={callout1}>
    The server used for your Chocolatey For Business environment should be a **_fresh, dedicated machine_** that serves no other purpose in your organization. Installation of C4B on a server running mission critical enterprise applications is **NOT** recommended.
</Callout>

Below are the minimum requirements for setting up your C4B server via this guide:

- Windows Server 2019+ (ideally, Windows Server 2022)
- 4+ CPU cores (more preferred)
- 16 GB+ RAM (8GB as a bare minimum; 4GB of RAM is reserved specifically for Nexus)
- 500 GB+ of free space for local NuGet package artifact storage (more is better, and you may have to grow this as your packages and versions increase)
- Open outgoing (egress) Internet access
- Administrator user rights

## Installation

### Step 0: Preparation of C4B Server

1. Provision your C4B server on the infrastructure of your choice.

1. Install all Windows Updates.

1. If you plan on joining this server to your Active Directory domain, do so now before beginning setup below.

1. If you plan to use a Purchased/Acquired or Domain SSL certificate, please ensure the CN/Subject value matches the DNS-resolvable Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of your C4B Server. Place this certificate in the `Local Machine > Personal` certificate store, and ensure that the private key is exportable.

1. Copy your `chocolatey.license.xml` license file (from the email you received) onto your C4B Server.

export const callout2 = {
    title: 'DISCLAIMER',
    type: 'warning'
};

<Callout content={callout2}>
    This guide utilizes code from a GitHub repository, namely: [choco-quickstart-scripts](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco-quickstart-scripts). Though we explain what each script does in drop-down boxes, please do your due diligence to review this code and ensure it meets your Organizational requirements.
</Callout>

export const callout3 = {
    title: 'Offline Install',
    type: 'info'
};

<Callout content={callout3}>
    If your C4B server does not have unrestricted access to the internet, you can download the `choco-quickstart-scripts` repository to a Windows machine that is connected to the internet and run `OfflineInstallPreparation.ps1`. This will use Chocolatey to save all of the required assets into the repository folder, which can then be transferred to the target C4B server.
    - Download [choco-quickstart-scripts by clicking here](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco-quickstart-scripts/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
    - Unzip it, e.g.: `Expand-Archive -Path ~\Downloads\choco-quickstart-scripts-main.zip -DestinationPath ~\Downloads\choco-quickstart-scripts`.
    - Run the OfflineInstallPreparation script, e.g.: `~\Downloads\choco-quickstart-scripts\choco-quickstart-scripts-main\OfflineInstallPreparation.ps1`.
    - Run the following to zip up your offline bundle: `Compress-Archive -Path ~\Downloads\choco-quickstart-scripts\choco-quickstart-scripts-main\* -DestinationPath ~\Downloads\C4B-Files.zip`.
    - Transfer the `C4B-Files.zip` from your downloads folder to your offline system. All further steps will be carried out on the offline system.
    - Run `Expand-Archive -Path \path\to\C4B-Files.zip -DestinationPath C:\choco-setup\files -Force` on your offline system.
    - Run `Set-Location "$env:SystemDrive\choco-setup\files"; Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass Process; .\Start-C4bSetup.ps1` on your offline system.
    - Proceed to Step 2!
</Callout>

### Step 1: Begin C4B Setup

export const callout4 = {
    title: 'IMPORTANT',
    type: 'danger'
};

<Callout content={callout4}>
    All commands must be run from an **elevated** Windows PowerShell window (and **not ISE**), by opening your PowerShell console with the `Run as Administrator` option.
</Callout>

1. Open a Windows PowerShell console with the `Run as Administrator` option, and paste and run the following code:

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
    [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::tls12
    Invoke-RestMethod https://ch0.co/qsg-go | Invoke-Expression
    ```

    > <details>
    > <summary><strong>What does this script do? (click to expand)</strong></summary>
    > <ul class="list-style-type-disc">
    > <li>Installs Chocolatey client from https://community.chocolatey.org</li>
    > <li>Prompts for your C4B license file location, with validation</li>
    > <li>Converts your C4B license into a Chocolatey package</li>
    > <li>Configures local "choco-setup" directories</li>
    > <li>Downloads setup files from "choco-quickstart-scripts" GitHub repo</li>
    > <li>Downloads Chocolatey packages required for setup</li>
    > </ul>
    > </details>

<Callout content={callout3}>
    You can now copy the `C:\choco-setup\` directory to any computer to continue the installation. To zip up that directory, run `Compress-Archive -Path C:\choco-setup\files\* -DestinationPath C:\choco-setup\C4B-Files.zip`. Move the archive to your new machine, and run `Expand-Archive -Path /path/to/C4B-Files.zip -DestinationPath C:\choco-setup\files -Force`. You should then run `Set-Location "$env:SystemDrive\choco-setup\files"; .\Start-C4bSetup.ps1`, and continue with the guide.
</Callout>

### Step 2: Nexus Setup

1. In the same **elevated** Windows PowerShell console as above, paste and run the following code:

    ```powershell
    Set-Location "$env:SystemDrive\choco-setup\files"
    .\Start-C4bNexusSetup.ps1
    ```

    > <details>
    > <summary><strong>What does this script do? (click to expand)</strong></summary>
    > <ul class="list-style-type-disc">
    > <li>Installs Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager OSS instance</li>
    > <li>Cleans up all demo repositories on Nexus</li>
    > <li>Creates a "ChocolateyInternal" NuGet repository</li>
    > <li>Creates a "ChocolateyTest" NuGet repository</li>
    > <li>Creates a "choco-install" raw repository</li>
    > <li>Sets up "ChocolateyInternal" on C4B Server as source, with API key</li>
    > <li>Adds firewall rule for repository access</li>
    > <li>Installs MS Edge, and disables first-run experience</li>
    > <li>Outputs data to a JSON file to pass between scripts</li>
    > </ul>
    > </details>

### Step 3: Chocolatey Central Management Setup

1. In the same PowerShell Administrator console as above, paste and run the following code:

    ```powershell
    Set-Location "$env:SystemDrive\choco-setup\files"
    .\Start-C4bCcmSetup.ps1
    ```

    > <details>
    > <summary><strong>What does this script do? (click to expand)</strong></summary>
    > <ul class="list-style-type-disc">
    > <li>Installs MS SQL Express and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)</li>
    > <li>Creates "ChocolateyManagement" database, and adds appropriate `ChocoUser` permissions</li>
    > <li>Installs all 3 Chocolatey Central Management packages (database, service, web), with correct parameters</li>
    > <li>Outputs data to a JSON file to pass between scripts</li>
    > </ul>
    > </details>

### Step 4: Jenkins Setup

1. In the same **elevated** PowerShell console as above, paste and run the following code:

    ```powershell
    Set-Location "$env:SystemDrive\choco-setup\files"
    .\Start-C4bJenkinsSetup.ps1
    ```

    > <details>
    > <summary><strong>What does this script do? (click to expand)</strong></summary>
    > <ul class="list-style-type-disc">
    > <li>Installs Jenkins package</li>
    > <li>Updates Jenkins plugins</li>
    > <li>Configures pre-downloaded Jenkins scripts for Package Internalizer automation</li>
    > <li>Sets up pre-defined Jenkins jobs for the scripts above</li>
    > </ul>
    > </details>

### Step 5: SSL Setup

1. In the same **elevated** PowerShell console as above, paste and run the following code:

    ```powershell
    Set-Location "$env:SystemDrive\choco-setup\files"
    .\Set-SslSecurity.ps1
    ```

    **ALTERNATIVE 1 : Custom SSL Certificate** - If you have your own custom SSL certificate (purchased/acquired, or from your Domain CA), you can paste and run the following script with the `Thumbprint` value of your SSL certificate specified:

    ```powershell
    Set-Location "$env:SystemDrive\choco-setup\files"
    .\Set-SslSecurity.ps1 -Thumbprint '<YOUR_CUSTOM_SSL_CERT_THUMBPRINT_HERE>'
    ```

    <Callout type="warning">
        If you are using your own SSL certificate, be sure to place this certificate in the `Local Machine > Personal` certificate store before running the above script, and ensure that the private key is exportable.
    </Callout>

    **ALTERNATIVE 2 : Wildcard SSL Certificate** - If you have a wildcard certificate, you will also need to provide a DNS name you wish to use for that certificate:

    ```powershell
    Set-Location "$env:SystemDrive\choco-setup\files"
    .\Set-SslSecurity.ps1 -Thumbprint '<YOUR_CUSTOM_SSL_CERT_THUMBPRINT_HERE>' -CertificateDnsName '<YOUR_DESIRED_FQDN_HERE>'
    ```

    For example, with a wildcard certificate with a thumbprint of `deee9b2fabb24bdaae71d82286e08de1` you wish to use `chocolatey.foo.org`, the following would be required:

    ```powershell
    Set-Location "$env:SystemDrive\choco-setup\files"
    .\Set-SslSecurity.ps1 -Thumbprint deee9b2fabb24bdaae71d82286e08de1 -CertificateDnsName chocolatey.foo.org
    ```

    <br />

    > <details>
    > <summary><strong>What does this script do? (click to expand)</strong></summary>
    > <ul class="list-style-type-disc">
    > <li>Adds SSL certificate configuration for Nexus and CCM web portals</li>
    > <li>A Role and User credential are configured to limit access to your Nexus repositories</li>
    > <li>CCM Client and Service Salts are configured to further encrypt the connection between CCM and your endpoint clients</li>
    > <li>Generates a `Register-C4bEndpoint.ps1` script for you to easily set up endpoint clients</li>
    > <li>Outputs data to a JSON file to pass between scripts</li>
    > <li>Writes a Readme.html file to the Public Desktop with account information for C4B services</li>
    > <li>Auto-opens README, CCM, Nexus, and Jenkins in your web browser</li>
    > <li>Removes temporary JSON files used during provisioning</li>
    > </ul>
    > </details>

    <Callout type="info">
        A `Readme.html` file will now be generated on your desktop. This file contains login information for all 3 web portals (CCM, Nexus, and Jenkins). This `Readme.html`, along with all 3 web portals, will automatically be opened in your browser.
    </Callout>

### Step 6: Verification

1. In the same **elevated** PowerShell console as above, paste and run the following code:

    ```powershell
    Set-Location "$env:SystemDrive\choco-setup\files"
    .\Start-C4bVerification.ps1 -Fqdn '<Your expected fqdn here>'
    ```

    If you expect services to be available at `chocoserver.yourcompany.com`, then your command would look like: `.\Start-C4bVerification.ps1 -Fqdn 'chocoserver.yourcompany.com'`

    > <details>
    > <summary><strong>What does this script do? (click to expand)</strong></summary>
    > <ul class="list-style-type-disc">
    > <li>Verifies Nexus Repository installation</li>
    > <li>Verifies Central Management installation</li>
    > <li>Verifies Jenkins installation</li>
    > <li>Ensures system firewall is configured</li>
    > <li>Ensures Windows Features are installed</li>
    > <li>Ensures services are correctly configured</li>
    > <li>Ensured README is created</li>
    > </ul>
    > </details>

### Step 7: Setting up Endpoints

1. Find the `Register-C4bEndpoint.ps1` script in the `choco-setup\files\scripts\` directory on your C4B Server. Copy this script to your client endpoint.

1. Open an **elevated** PowerShell console on your client endpoint, and browse (`cd`) to the location you copied the script above. Paste and run the following code:

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
    [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::tls12
    .\Register-C4bEndpoint.ps1 -RepositoryCredential (Get-Credential) # Will prompt for username and password. Values found in README on Server Desktop.
    ```

    > <details>
    > <summary><strong>What does this script do? (click to expand)</strong></summary>
    > <ul class="list-style-type-disc">
    > <li>Installs Chocolatey client (chocolatey), using a script from your raw "choco-install" repository</li>
    > <li>Runs the "ClientSetup.ps1" script from your raw "choco-install" repository, which does the following:</li>
    > <li>Licenses Chocolatey by installing the license package (chocolatey-license) created during QDE setup</li>
    > <li>Installs the Chocolatey Licensed Extension (chocolatey.extension) without context menus</li>
    > <li>Configures "ChocolateyInternal" source</li>
    > <li>Disables access to the "chocolatey" public Chocolatey Community Repository (CCR)</li>
    > <li>Configures Self-Service mode and installs Chocolatey GUI (chocolateygui) along with its licensed extension (chocolateygui.extension)</li>
    > <li>Configures Central Management (CCM) check-in, and opts endpoints into CCM Deployments</li>
    > </ul>
    > </details>

    #### Available parameters

    * `ClientCommunicationSalt` - Chocolatey Central Management Client Communication Salt Additive - The salt additive to use in the salt recipe for encrypting and verifying communication from an agent TO an instance of Central Management Service (will need to be set the same on all clients contacting that service AND the instance of the management service itself). When not set a default encryption phrase set by the system will be used. When set the unencrypted value must match exactly with what is set in the configuration for Central Management Service and every client contacting that instance of Central Management Service. Value is not shared over the wire. Because this is a much more involved process, it is recommended only setting this if you are transmitting messages over the internet. Defaults to ''. Needs to be at least 8 characters long if set or it will throw errors and use the default. Available in business editions only. IMPORTANT: If this value is set, agents less than v0.10.0 will be unable to contact Central Management to report in.
    * `ServiceCommunicationSalt` -Chocolatey Central Management Service Communication Salt Additive - The salt additive to use in the salt recipe for encrypting and verifying communication FROM an instance of Central Management Service to an agent (will need to be set the same on all clients contacting that service AND the instance of the management service itself). When not set a default encryption phrase set by the system will be used. When set the unencrypted value must match exactly with what is set in the configuration for Central Management Service and every client contacting that instance of Central Management Service. Value is not shared over the wire. Because this is a much more involved process, it is recommended only setting this if you are transmitting messages over the internet. Defaults to ''. Needs to be at least 8 characters long if set or it will throw errors and use the default. Available in business editions only.
    * `RepositoryCredential` - The credential to use to access the repository server from the endpoint. Details available from README file on server desktop.
    * `ProxyUrl` - The URL of a proxy server to use for connecting to the repository.
    * `ProxyCredential` - The credentials, if required, to connect to the proxy server.
    * `IncludePackageTools` - Install the Chocolatey Licensed Extension with right-click context menus available
    * `AdditionalConfiguration` - Allows for the application of user-defined configuration that is applied after the base configuration.
    * `AdditionalFeatures` - Allows for the toggling of additional features that is applied after the base configuration.
    * `AdditionalPackages` - Allows for the installation of additional packages after the system base packages have been installed.
    * `AdditionalSources` - Allows for the addition of alternative sources after the base configuration has been applied.
    * `TrustCertificate` - If passed, downloads the certificate from the client server before initializing Chocolatey Agent

#### Advanced Endpoint Configuration

It is possible to customize the installtion of Chocolatey on an endpoint via the available parameters above. For examples, please see <Xref title='Advanced Endpoint Configuration' value='qsg-advanced-endpoint-config'/>

### Conclusion

Congratulations! If you followed all the steps detailed above, you should now have a fully functioning Chocolatey for Business implementation deployed in your environment.

It is worth mentioning that some customers may have a more bespoke environment, with the presence of proxies and additional configuration management applications. Chocolatey is engineered to be quite flexible, specifically to account for these scenarios. Please refer to the many options for installation referenced on the <Xref title="Installation page" value="setup-licensed" anchor="more-install-options" />. Again, If you have any questions or would like to discuss more involved implementations, please feel free to reach out to your Chocolatey representative.
