Welcome to the Chocolatey for Business (C4B) Quick-Start Guide! This guide will walk you through the basics of configuring a C4B Server on your VM infrastructure of choice. This includes:

- The Chocolatey Licensed components
- A NuGet V3 Repository (Nexus)
- Chocolatey Central Management (CCM)
- An Automation Pipeline (Jenkins)

<Callout type="info">
    This quick-start guide is intended for customers who have recently purchased Chocolatey for Business (C4B), or are evaluating C4B as part of a proof-of-concept.
    It is **opinionated**, and thus illustrates only one method of setting up your Chocolatey environment.
    Our goal is to get you up-and-running smoothly and efficiently in order to fully test out the feature set.
    For a more exhaustive reference of possible setup scenarios, you may refer to the <Xref title="Organizational Deployment Documentation" value="organizational-deployment-guide" />.
</Callout>

If you have any questions or would like to discuss more involved implementations, please feel free to reach out to your Chocolatey representative.

Let's get started!

## Components

<img class="mb-3" src="https://img.chocolatey.org/docs/c4b/c4b-server.png" alt="Chocolatey for Business Server Components" width="600"/>

As illustrated in the diagram above, there are four main components to a Chocolatey for Business installation:

1. **C4B Licensed components**: A licensed version of Chocolatey includes:
    - Installation of the Chocolatey OSS client package itself (`chocolatey`)
    - Chocolatey license file (`chocolatey.license.xml`) installed in the correct directory (`ProgramData\chocolatey\license`)
    - Installation of the Chocolatey Licensed extension (`chocolatey.extension`), giving you access to features like Package Builder, Package Internalizer, etc. (full list [here](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/features/)).
    <p></p>

1. **NuGet V3 Repository Server App (Nexus)**: Chocolatey works best with a NuGet V3 repository. This application hosts and manages versioning of your Chocolatey package artifacts, in their enhanced NuGet package (.nupkg) file format. The quick start guide helps you setup [Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager (OSS)](https://www.sonatype.com/products/nexus-repository).

1. **Chocolatey Central Management (CCM)**: CCM is the Web UI portal for your entire Chocolatey environment. Your endpoints check-in to CCM to report their package status. This includes the Chocolatey packages they have installed, and whether any of these packages are outdated. And now, with CCM Deployments, you can also deploy packages or package updates to groups of endpoints, as well as ad-hoc PowerShell commands. CCM is backed by an MS SQL Database. This guide will set up MS SQL Express for you.

1. **Automation Pipeline (Jenkins)**: A pipeline tool will help you automate repetitive tasks, such checking for updates to a set of Chocolatey Packages from the Chocolatey Community Repository (CCR). If updates exist, the pipeline task will auto-internalize your list of packages, and push them into your NuGet repository for you. This guide will help you set up Jenkins as your automation pipeline.

## Requirements

<Callout content={importantcallout}>
    The server used for your Chocolatey For Business environment should be a **_fresh, dedicated machine_** that serves no other purpose in your organization. Installation of C4B on a server running mission critical enterprise applications is **NOT** recommended.
</Callout>

Below are the minimum requirements for setting up your C4B server via this guide:

- Windows Server 2019+ (ideally, Windows Server 2022)
- 4+ CPU cores (more preferred)
- 16 GB+ RAM (8GB as a bare minimum; 4GB of RAM is reserved specifically for Nexus)
- 500 GB+ of free space for local NuGet package artifact storage (more is better, and you may have to grow this as your packages and versions increase)
- Open outgoing (egress) Internet access
- Administrator user rights

## Installation

### Step 0: Preparation of C4B Server

1. Provision your C4B server on the infrastructure of your choice.

1. Install all Windows Updates.

1. If you plan on joining this server to your Active Directory domain, do so now before beginning setup below.

1. If you plan to use a Purchased/Acquired or Domain SSL certificate, please ensure the CN/Subject value matches the DNS-resolvable Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of your C4B Server. Place this certificate in the `Local Machine > Trusted People` certificate store, and ensure that the private key is exportable.

1. Copy your `chocolatey.license.xml` license file (from the email you received) onto your C4B Server.

<Callout content={disclaimercallout}>
    This guide utilizes code from a GitHub repository, namely: [choco-quickstart-scripts](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco-quickstart-scripts). Though we explain what each script does in drop-down boxes, please do your due diligence and review this code to ensure it meets your Organizational requirements.
</Callout>

export const callout3 = {
    title: 'Offline Install',
    type: 'info'
};

<Callout content={callout3}>
    If your C4B server does not have unrestricted access to the internet, you can download the `choco-quickstart-scripts` repository to a Windows machine that is connected to the internet and run `OfflineInstallPreparation.ps1`. This will use Chocolatey to save all of the required assets into the repository folder, which can then be transferred to the target C4B server.
    - Download [choco-quickstart-scripts by clicking here](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco-quickstart-scripts/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
    - Unzip it, e.g.: `Expand-Archive -Path ~\Downloads\choco-quickstart-scripts-main.zip -DestinationPath ~\Downloads\choco-quickstart-scripts`.
    - Run the OfflineInstallPreparation script, e.g.: `~\Downloads\choco-quickstart-scripts\choco-quickstart-scripts-main\OfflineInstallPreparation.ps1`.
    - Run the following to zip up your offline bundle: `Compress-Archive -Path ~\Downloads\choco-quickstart-scripts\choco-quickstart-scripts-main\* -DestinationPath ~\Downloads\C4B-Files.zip`.
    - Transfer the `C4B-Files.zip` from your downloads folder to your offline system. All further steps will be carried out on the offline system.
    - Run `Expand-Archive -Path \path\to\C4B-Files.zip -DestinationPath C:\choco-setup\files -Force` on your offline system.
    - Proceed to Certificate Options!
</Callout>

### Step 1: Begin C4B Setup

1. Open an elevated Windows PowerShell console with the `Run as Administrator` option, and paste and run the following code:

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
    [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::tls12
    Invoke-RestMethod https://ch0.co/qsg-go | Invoke-Expression
    ```

2. Run `Initialize-C4bSetup.ps1` with your chosen certificate option:

    <Callout content={importantcallout}>
        If you are using your own SSL certificate, be sure to place this certificate in the `Local Machine > Trusted People` certificate store before running the following script, and ensure that the private key is exportable as the scripts need to create a Java keystore for Nexus and Jenkins.
    </Callout>

    <TabsTabContainer content={certificateTabs} />
    <TabsPaneContainer>
        <TabsPane content={certificateTabs[0]}>
            If you have your own custom SSL certificate (purchased/acquired, or from your Domain CA), you can paste and run the following script with the `Thumbprint` value of your SSL certificate specified:

            ```powershell
            Set-Location "$env:SystemDrive\choco-setup\files"
            .\Initialize-C4bSetup.ps1 -Thumbprint '<YOUR_CUSTOM_SSL_CERT_THUMBPRINT_HERE>'
            ```
        </TabsPane>
        <TabsPane content={certificateTabs[1]}>
            If you have a wildcard certificate, you will also need to provide a DNS name you wish to use for that certificate:

            ```powershell
            Set-Location "$env:SystemDrive\choco-setup\files"
            .\Initialize-C4bSetup.ps1 -Thumbprint '<YOUR_CUSTOM_SSL_CERT_THUMBPRINT_HERE>' -CertificateDnsName '<YOUR_DESIRED_FQDN_HERE>'
            ```

            For example, with a wildcard certificate with a thumbprint of `deee9b2fabb24bdaae71d82286e08de1` you wish to use `chocolatey.foo.org`, the following would be required:

            ```powershell
            Set-Location "$env:SystemDrive\choco-setup\files"
            .\Initialize-C4bSetup.ps1 -Thumbprint deee9b2fabb24bdaae71d82286e08de1 -CertificateDnsName chocolatey.foo.org
            ```
        </TabsPane>
        <TabsPane content={certificateTabs[2]}>
            If you are running a bare-minimum proof of concept environment, you can generate a self-signed certificate and use that.

            ```powershell
            Set-Location "$env:SystemDrive\choco-setup\files"
            .\Initialize-C4bSetup.ps1
            ```
        </TabsPane>
    </TabsPaneContainer>

### Step 2: Setting up Endpoints

1. Find the `Register-C4bEndpoint.ps1` script in the `C:\choco-setup\files\scripts\` directory on your C4B Server. Copy this script to your client endpoint.

1. Open an **elevated** PowerShell console on your client endpoint, and browse (`cd`) to the location you copied the script above. Paste and run the following code:

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
    [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::tls12
    .\Register-C4bEndpoint.ps1 -RepositoryCredential (Get-Credential) # Will prompt for username and password. Values found in README on Server Desktop.
