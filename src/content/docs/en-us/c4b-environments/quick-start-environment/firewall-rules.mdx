## External Firewall Ports (Optional)

<Callout type="warning">
    - Performing this incorrectly could cause security issues and possibly cause you to be subjected to copyright law/redistribution. Read all of this first.
    - DO NOT OPEN these ports externally until you have done the following:
      - Locked down your repositories to user/pass access.
      - Updated your ClientSetup script within the raw client repository.
</Callout>

These are ports that need to be opened through the corporate firewall, if users are **not** on VPN and need to install packages from anywhere.

## FAQ

### Can I open up the Chocolatey Central Management Service's port to allow machines to report in from anywhere?

For best results, we recommend using a VPN connection for client check-ins.
The Chocolatey Central Management service connection is authenticated over SSL, but our best practice recommendation is to secure the connection over a VPN as well.
With Chocolatey Central Management v0.3.0+, more security has been put into allowing for checking in over internet connections. We _highly_ recommend setting both a `centralManagementClientCommunicationSaltAdditivePassword` and `centralManagementServiceCommunicationSaltAdditivePassword` Chocolatey configuration value on your client machines and Chocolatey Central Management Service host machine.
