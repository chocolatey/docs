## Upgrade Nexus in Quick Start Environment

This document outlines the process for upgrading Nexus running inside our Quick Start Environment.
The script provided assumes your server has access to the internet to download the Nexus package from the community repository.
If your server is restricted then internalize the package to your internal repository and update the source in the script appropriately.

<Callout type="warning">
    The instructions on this page use parameters available to the nexus-repository package to conserve SSL configuration. If you have arrived here,
    and do not have a Nexus instance configured with SSL, leave off the package parameters.

    This command will backup the SSL configuration to the root of your User Profile in a NexusBackup folder.
