## Summary

Once you have your Chocolatey for Business Azure Environment deployed, you'll need to get clients talking to it.
To do that, you'll need to do the following on the clients:

1. Setup DNS to allow access to the environment.
1. Install the SSL/TLS certificate, if self-signed, so clients can access HTTPS components.
1. Install Chocolatey components and configure the client for Chocolatey for Business (C4B) deployments.

## DNS

Ensure that you have <Xref title="configured DNS" value="c4b-azure" anchor="dns-configuration" /> to direct clients to your deployed environment.

Once you've added the required CNAME record, clients should be able to access it.

## SSL Certificate

<Callout type="info">
    If you used an SSL certificate from an external Certificate Authority (CA), or internally trusted PKI CA, your clients will automatically trust it and you can skip this section.
</Callout>

If you used a self-signed certificate to deploy your Chocolatey for Business Azure Environment, you will need to import this certificate to the `Trusted Root Certification Authorities` store on the clients.

1. Open the Microsoft Management Console (`MMC.msc`)
1. Select **File** -> **Add/Remove Snap-in...**
1. Select **Certificates** and click **Add >**
1. Choose **Computer account** and click **Next**, **Finish**, then **OK**
1. Expand **Certificates (Local Computer)**
1. Right-click **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**, and select **All Tasks** -> **Import**

1. Click **Next**
1. Browse to the self-signed certificate file
    1. You may need to adjust the filetype so that you can see `.pfx` files

1. Click **Next**
1. Enter the password supplied when creating the certificate
1. Click **Next**, **Next**, then **Finish**
1. Close the Microsoft Management Console

## Endpoint Registration

To on-board clients, you can run the following script, which will download all requirements from your environment and configure it with our suggested defaults.

<Callout type="info">
    Updating the values here will update the script below - no values are sent to a server, they are temporarily stored locally in your browser.
</Callout>

You will require the following values to run this script:

* `FQDN`: The fully qualified domain name used to access your environment.
    <DynamicCodeBlockInput name="AzureFqdnValue" defaultValue="Enter the FQDN for your Chocolatey for Business Azure Environment here..." />
* `ccmClientCommunicationSalt`: This is the client-side salt additive. More information about this can be found in the <Xref title="C4B Config Settings" value="ccm-client" anchor="config-settings" /> docs.
    <DynamicCodeBlockInput name="AzureCcmClientSaltValue" defaultValue="Enter your ccmClientCommunicationSalt here..." />
* `ccmServiceCommunicationSalt`: This is the server-side salt additive. More information about this can be found in the <Xref title="C4B Config Settings" value="ccm-client" anchor="config-settings" /> docs.
    <DynamicCodeBlockInput name="AzureCcmServiceSaltValue" defaultValue="Enter your ccmServiceCommunicationSalt here..." />
* `ChocoUserPassword`: The password for the `chocouser` account which is used by the client to access your environments' Sonatype Nexus Repository service.
    <DynamicCodeBlockInput name="AzureChocoUserPasswordValue" defaultValue="Enter your ChocoUserPassword here..." />

Except for the `FQDN`, all of these values are available in your deployed environment's Azure Key Vault.
See <Xref title="Accessing Services" value="c4b-azure" anchor="accessing-services" /> for more information about retrieving values from the Vault.

When you're ready, save the following script to the target client (e.g. as `Register-C4bEndpoint.ps1`) and run it from an elevated (Run as Administrator) PowerShell session (e.g. `~\path\to\Register-C4bEndpoint.ps1`):

<DynamicCodeBlock language="powershell">
{`
[CmdletBinding(HelpUri = 'https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/c4b-environments/quick-start-environment/advanced-client-configuration/')]
param(
    # The DNS name of the server that hosts your repository, Jenkins, and Chocolatey Central Management
    [String]$Fqdn = 'AzureFqdnValue',

    # Client salt value used to populate the centralManagementClientCommunicationSaltAdditivePassword value in the Chocolatey config file
    [String]$ClientCommunicationSalt = 'AzureCcmClientSaltValue',

    # Server salt value used to populate the centralManagementServiceCommunicationSaltAdditivePassword value in the Chocolatey config file
    [String]$ServiceCommunicationSalt = 'AzureCcmServiceSaltValue',

    # The credential for accessing your Nexus repository, e.g. for 'chocouser'
    $RepositoryCredential = [System.Net.NetworkCredential]@{
        'userName' = 'chocouser'
        'password' = 'AzureChocoUserPasswordValue'
    },

    # Install the Chocolatey Licensed Extension with right-click context menus available
    [Switch]$IncludePackageTools,

    # Allows for the application of user-defined configuration that is applied after the base configuration.
    # Can override base configuration with this parameter
    [Hashtable]$AdditionalConfiguration,

    # Can override base configuration with this parameter
    [Hashtable]$AdditionalFeatures,

    [Hashtable[]]$AdditionalPackages,

    # Can override base configuration with this parameter
    [Hashtable[]]$AdditionalSources
)
$RepositoryCredential = [PSCredential]::new($RepositoryCredential.UserName, $RepositoryCredential.SecurePassword)
$params = $PSBoundParameters
$PSCmdlet.MyInvocation.MyCommand.Parameters.Keys.Where{
    $_ -notin [System.Management.Automation.PSCmdlet]::CommonParameters + "FQDN" -and -not $params.ContainsKey($_)
}.ForEach{ $params[$_] = (Get-Variable -Name $_ -Scope 0 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).Value }
$params.RepositoryUrl = "https://$($fqdn)/nexus/repository/ChocolateyInternal/index.json"

$downloader = [System.Net.WebClient]::new()
$downloader.Credentials = $RepositoryCredential

$script = $downloader.DownloadString("https://$($FQDN)/nexus/repository/choco-install/ClientSetup.ps1")

& ([scriptblock]::Create($script)) @params

</DynamicCodeBlock>

This script will accomplish the following on your client:

1. Install Chocolatey CLI from the installation script hosted in your internal raw Sonatype Nexus Repository.
1. Add the `ChocolateyInternal` source, and enable it for self-service
1. Disable the default `chocolatey` source.
1. Install your Chocolatey license using the `chocolatey-license` package.
1. Install the Chocolatey Licensed Extension (without context menus for Package Builder).
1. Install the `ChocolateyGUI` package on the endpoint, for self-service support.
1. Install the `chocolatey-agent` package, which supports self-service and Chocolatey Central Management communication.
1. Enable and disable features related to configuring self-service access on the endpoint.
1. Setup the communication channel between the endpoint and Chocolatey Central Management, using the correct URL and salts.
1. Enable Chocolatey Central Management Deployments.

For further details on how you can customize your install using this script, please refer to the <Xref title="Advanced Client Configuration article" value="qsg-advanced-endpoint-config" />.
