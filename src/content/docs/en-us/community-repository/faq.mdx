### How Do I Ask Questions About a Package?

If you have a question about the _package_, please follow **both** these steps:

1. [Contact the package Maintainers](#how-do-i-contact-the-package-maintainers). Some Maintainers have opted-out of receiving email, so this option may not be available.
1. [Find the package source](#how-do-i-find-the-package-source) and if the repository supports it, raise a discussion. The majority of Maintainers have the package source on a platform such as GitHub which allows issues and discussions to be created, if enabled.

### How Do I Ask Questions About the Package Software?

If you have questions about the _software_ the package installs, please contact the Software Vendor/Author. Maintainers do not provide support for the software that is packaged.

If you want to ask questions about the _package_, see [here](#how-do-i-ask-questions-about-a-package).

### How Do I Contact the Package Maintainers?

You may want to contact the package maintainers with package questions, or to report a broken or outdated package. On the [Chocolatey Community Repository](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages) package page, click the **Contact Maintainers** link.

![Contact Maintainers link on the Chocolatey Community Repository package page](https://img.chocolatey.org/docs/maintainers/triage-maintainers.jpg)

If your question is about the software installed by the package, please contact the Software Vendor or Author directly as package maintainers cannot provide software support. The exception is if the package Maintainer is also the Software Vendor/Author. You can find out who the package maintainers are on the [Chocolatey Community Repository](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages) package page.

### How Do I Create Chocolatey Packages?

### How Do I Inspect the Contents of a Chocolatey Package?

<Callout type="info">
    Packages submitted before 2014 do not have files listed under the **Files** section.
</Callout>

The contents of every Chocolatey package is available to be inspected both on the Chocolatey Community Repository package page under the **Files** section.

![Chocolatey Community Repository package files section with chocolateyInstall.ps1 PowerShell script expanded](https://img.chocolatey.org/docs/moderation/moderation-10.jpg)

You can also download the actual package and inspect the contents. On the left menu there is a **Download** button where you can download and rename the `.nupkg` file extension to `.zip`, extract it and see the contents.

Packages can have multiple version, both stable and prerelease. All of these versions are listed on the package page and can be found by scrolling down the page to the **Version History** section and clicking the link.

![Version History section of the package page on the Chocolatey Community Repository](https://img.chocolatey.org/docs/faqs/packagepage-versionhistory.jpg)

Only a limited number are shown initially. If there are more version available, click the **Show Additional Versions** button to view them all.

We take package abuse very seriously. But what is package abuse, or an abusive package?

There are many definitions of what could make a package, or the software it installs, abusive. An abusive package could be:

* A package that installs software that contains malware, adware, or potentially unwanted applications (PUA).
* A package that violates <Xref title="distribution rights" value="legal" anchor="distributions" />.

If a package is abusive, please report it by clicking on the **Report Abuse** link on the package page, fill out and submit the form. The Site Administrators will follow up with you.

### Why do I get a 500 Internal Server Error when trying to push my package?

If you receive a `500 Internal Server Error` when pushing a package, you may have a malformed package that the server was unable to process.
One such case is documented in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/chocolatey/home/issues/303).

Make sure that none of the `<file ...>` entries in the `nuspec` file of your package have name collisions with other files or folders being packed.
This is usually rare but can be encountered more commonly if you are trying to pack files which don't have a file extension.
For example, if you have `<file>` entries that may look like this, you will need to change the name of the file or folder in the package to avoid collision:

```xml
<file src="bin\*" target="bin" />
<file src="file-with-no-extension" target="bin" />
```

There are two possible solutions for this particular case:

```xml
<!-- option 1: rename the file to have a file extension -->
<file src="bin\*" target="bin" />
<file src="file-with.extension" target="bin" />

<!-- option 2: specify the full path to the file in the package as the target, instead of just the folder name -->
<file src="bin\*" target="bin" />
<file src="file-with-no-extension" target="bin\file-with-no-extension" />
```

See an [issue we raised on the NuGet repository](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13273) for more information on the NuGet bug which can cause this kind of malformed package.

If you receive a `500: Internal Server Error` that is not related to this specific case, please [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/chocolatey/home) so we can investigate the issue.
