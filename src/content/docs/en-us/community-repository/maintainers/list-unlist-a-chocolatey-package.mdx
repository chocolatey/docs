## The Problem

From time to time, the visibility of a previously approved Chocolatey package version needs to be changed. This could be for a number of reasons, for example:

* The package version was uploaded in error.
* The installer or embedded files are no longer available.

Leaving a package as listed could mean that any user who tries to install or upgrade this package might get an error, and this is far from ideal.

## The Solution

You can change the visibility of an individual Chocolatey package version by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the package page, scroll down, and expand, **Version History**. If a package is listed, and visible on the Chocolatey Community Repository it will say **yes**. If a package is unlisted, it will say **no**.

1. Under the **Listed** column, click **yes** next to the version you want to unlist, or **no** next to the version you want to list.

1. To unlist the package version, untick the box next to **List..**. To list the package version, ensure the box is ticked. Click **Save Changes** to update the package visibility.

1. Check the visibility of the package has been updated by expanding **Version History** again.

## FAQ

### Can I list or unlist all versions of a package at once?

At this time you cannot list or unlist all versions of a package at once. You must list or unlist individual package versions.
