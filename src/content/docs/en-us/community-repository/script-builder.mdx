Script Builder allows you to bulk install Chocolatey packages in just a few clicks by providing clear, step-by-step instructions, on how to get packages into your environment quickly and easily using generated scripts. Just add packages to the builder and choose your integration method to get started.

<Callout type="info">
    Packages selected in Script Builder, the [internal repository url](#internal-repository-url) provided, and your selected integration method are saved within the browser on your computer and will not be available on other computers.
</Callout>

## Adding and removing packages

<Callout type="info">
    Package versions are always included in generated scripts. In a future release, a toggle will be provided to remove version numbers.
</Callout>

Packages can be added or removed from Script Builder virtually anywhere:

1. From the main list of packages.

1. From the individual package page.  
  ![Add package from the package details page](https://img.chocolatey.org/docs/script-builder/sb-add-package-page.jpg)

1. And even from the version history table on the individual package page. Multiple versions of the same package cannot be added to Script Builder.

## Specifics for Organizational Use

<Callout type="warning">
    The organizational use of the Chocolatey Community Repository is not recommended. Please see how to setup <Xref title="Chocolatey for internal / organizational use" value="organizational-deployment-guide" />.
</Callout>

When using Script Builder for an organization, follow these steps:

1. Enter your [internal repository url](#internal-repository-url).
1. Get the [packages into your environment](#environment-setup).
1. Copy the installation scripts and configuration scripts.

### Integration Methods

Currently, Script Builder provides installation and configuration scripts as a generic PowerShell script as well as Ansible, Chef, PowerShell DSC, and Puppet.

### Internal Repository Url

The Internal Repository Url is the location of your internal package repository. Read over <Xref title="How To Set Up an Internal Repository" value="host-packages" /> for options and more information on using Artifactory Pro, Nexus, and ProGet.

export const callout1 = {
    title: 'IMPORTANT',
    type: 'danger'
};

<Callout content={callout1}>
    An Internal Repository Url is required and you will not be able to proceed with further steps in Script Builder until one is supplied.
</Callout>

### Environment Setup

Script Builder provides the instructions on how to get your selected packages into your specific environment.

<Callout type="info">
    When choosing to bulk download packages from this step, your browser may block multiple pop-ups, resulting in only 1 package being downloaded. To avoid this, be sure to add community.chocolatey.org to your list of approved sites to allow pop-ups and redirects.
</Callout>
