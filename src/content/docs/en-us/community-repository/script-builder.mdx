Script Builder allows you to bulk install Chocolatey packages in just a few clicks by providing clear, step-by-step instructions, on how to get packages into your environment quickly and easily using generated scripts. Just add packages to the builder and choose your integration method to get started.

<Callout type="info">
    Packages selected in Script Builder, the [internal repository url](#internal-repository-url) provided, and your selected integration method are saved within the browser on your computer and will not be available on other computers.
</Callout>

## Adding and removing packages

<Callout type="info">
    Package versions are always included in generated scripts. In a future release, a toggle will be provided to remove version numbers.
</Callout>

Packages can be added or removed from Script Builder virtually anywhere:

1. From the main list of packages.

1. From the individual package page.

1. And even from the version history table on the individual package page. Multiple versions of the same package cannot be added to Script Builder.

### Integration Methods

Currently, Script Builder provides installation and configuration scripts as a generic PowerShell script as well as Ansible, Chef, PowerShell DSC, and Puppet.

### Internal Repository Url

The Internal Repository Url is the location of your internal package repository. Read over <Xref title="How To Set Up an Internal Repository" value="host-packages" /> for options and more information on using Artifactory Pro, Nexus, and ProGet.

export const callout1 = {
    title: 'IMPORTANT',
    type: 'danger'
};

<Callout content={callout1}>
    An Internal Repository Url is required and you will not be able to proceed with further steps in Script Builder until one is supplied.
</Callout>

### Environment Setup

Script Builder provides the instructions on how to get your selected packages into your specific environment.

<Callout type="info">
    When choosing to bulk download packages from this step, your browser may block multiple pop-ups, resulting in only 1 package being downloaded. To avoid this, be sure to add community.chocolatey.org to your list of approved sites to allow pop-ups and redirects.
</Callout>
