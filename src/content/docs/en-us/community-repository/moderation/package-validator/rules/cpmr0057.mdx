## Issue

The nuspec is missing the recent enhancements that give consumers information related to the underlying software.

## Recommended Solution

Please update the nuspec to contain one or more of the following:

  * `docsUrl` - points to the location of the wiki or docs of the software
  * `mailingListUrl` - points to the forum or email list group for the software
  * `bugTrackerUrl` - points to the location where issues and tickets can be accessed
  * `packageSourceUrl` - points to the location of your chocolatey package files in source (e.g. `https://github.com/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-packages`)
  * `projectSourceUrl` - points to the location of the underlying software source

<Callout type="info">
    You must use `choco pack` with at least version [0.9.9.7](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/release-notes#june-20-2015) (see [#205](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/205)) to use these elements. Using NuGet or `nuget.exe` will error on this element.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
    If your nuspec file is missing these fields, you should run `choco new testpkg` and look at the output from that (ensure you have the [latest version of Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages?q=id%3Achocolatey)).
</Callout>

## Reasoning

This provides folks with more information related to the software itself and gives folks a quick location reference to start from when attempting to find more information related to a project.
