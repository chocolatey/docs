## Issue

In the nuspec, one of the URLs provided is invalid. Usually this means that the URL does not actually go to a website.

The following URL's, if invalid, will be marked as a Guideline (would be good if it could be fixed).

* description - Guideline
* releaseNotes - Guideline

<Callout type="info">
    Within the Description and ReleaseNotes elements, all URL's contained within them will be validated.
</Callout>

## Recommended Solution

Please update the incorrect field(s) so that it results in a valid URL.

## Reasoning

We expect that the URLs actually go to an existing URL

## Troubleshooting

We have worked through a number of issues where valid URL were actually being flagged as invalid.  If you believe that a valid URL within your nuspec file is being flagged as invalid, please reply on the package moderation page, and a moderator can help investigate.
