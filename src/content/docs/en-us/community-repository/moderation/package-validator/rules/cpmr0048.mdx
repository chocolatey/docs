## Issue

In the nuspec, there is a `<tag />` element that contains `chocolatey` as one of the values.

## Recommended Solution

Please update the nuspec to remove `chocolatey` from the list of tags.

## Reasoning

Tags are about the underlying software. If that software has little or nothing to do with Chocolatey, there is no reason to carry the `chocolatey` tag. The `chocolatey` tag is specifically for things that are about Chocolatey and its framework, not about packages that can be installed with Chocolatey. If the purpose was for packages that are Chocolatey compatible, every package on https://community.chocolatey.org/packages would contain `chocolatey` for a tag and thus reduce the usefulness of the tag.
