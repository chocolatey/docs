## Issue

In the package, you have included binaries but have not given moderators and the community a way to verify the files are legitimate.

## Recommended Solution

Please add a file named VERIFICATION.txt. You can see the format for that file if you call `choco new test` (upgrade to the latest version of Chocolatey first) and look at the generated file in `test\tools\VERIFICATION.txt`

This check also looks for `VERIFICATION` and `VERIFICATION.md`. Casing doesn't matter for validation.

## Reasoning

If you include binaries in the package, even if you are the software vendor, you need to include a VERIFICATION.txt file. This allows moderators and the community build trust in using the package. A verification file tells folks how to verify the files are legitimate with specific instructions on verifying with the official location.
