## Issue

In the nuspec, there is a `<licenseUrl>` element. It was found to be missing or empty in the package.

## Recommended Solution

Please update the nuspec to include a `<licenseUrl />` element that is non-empty. If your nuspec file is missing this field, you should run `choco new testpkg` and look at the output from that (ensure you have the [latest version of Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages?q=id%3Achocolatey)).

## Reasoning

If you want to require license acceptance, you must include the license url.
