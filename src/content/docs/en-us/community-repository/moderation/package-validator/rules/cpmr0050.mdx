<Callout type="warning">
    There was a bug where it was not taking case into account. We've fixed the bug, but you may end up here - https://github.com/chocolatey/home/issues/32
</Callout>

## Issue

In the nuspec, the id of the package `<id />` was found to match exactly with `<title />`.

## Recommended Solution

In the nuspec, ensure the `<id />` is completely lowercase (e.g. "`thispackage`") and the `<title />` uses title case (e.g. "`This Package`").

## Reasoning

In general, the id should be lowercase ("`thispackage`") and a title should have title case ("`ThisPackage`"). The names may match, but what we are generally searching for is whether someone has ran the template generation and then forgotten to update the title in the nuspec to something more appropriate.
