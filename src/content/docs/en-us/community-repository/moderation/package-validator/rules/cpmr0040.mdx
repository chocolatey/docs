## Issue

In the nuspec, a `<packageSourceUrl />` was not found to exist. This is the url to the chocolatey package repository, not the software (unless they are the same).

## Recommended Solution

Please add `packageSourceUrl`, pointing to the url where the Chocolatey package source resides. You must use `choco pack` with at least version [0.9.9.7](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/release-notes#june-20-2015) (see [#205](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/205)) to do this. Using NuGet or `nuget.exe` will error on this element.  If your nuspec file is missing this field, you should run `choco new testpkg` and look at the output from that (ensure you have the [latest version of Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages?q=id%3Achocolatey)).

## Reasoning

`packageSourceUrl` allows potential collaborators to easily find your package source so they can provide fixes.
