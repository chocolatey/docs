## Issue

In the nuspec the description is less than the required amount of characters.

## Recommended Solution

Update the description for the package to include a description that has more than 30 characters.

## Reasoning

It is not enough to just add a few words to the description.
The description should be sufficient enough to explain what the software that is packaged is, and why people should use the software.
