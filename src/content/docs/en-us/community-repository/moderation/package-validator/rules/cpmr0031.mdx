<PackageValidatorRuleNote />

## Issue

In the nuspec, one of the URLs provided is invalid. Usually this means that the URL does not actually go to a website.

The following URL's, if invalid, will be marked as a Note.

* bugTrackerUrl - Note
* docsUrl - Note
* iconUrl - Note
* licenseUrl - Note
* mailingListUrl - Note
* packageSourceUrl - Note
* projectSourceUrl - Note
* projectUrl - Note
* wikiUrl - Note

<Callout type="info">
    Within the Description and ReleaseNotes elements, all URL's contained within them will be validated.
</Callout>

## Recommended Solution

Please update the incorrect field(s) so that it results in a valid URL.

## Reasoning

We expect that the URLs actually go to an existing URL

## Troubleshooting

We have worked through a number of issues where valid URL were actually being flagged as invalid.  If you believe that a valid URL within your nuspec file is being flagged as invalid, please reply on the package moderation page, and a moderator can help investigate.
