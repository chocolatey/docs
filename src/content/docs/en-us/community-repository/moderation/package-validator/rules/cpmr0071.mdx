## Issue

In an automation script (`.ps1`/`.psm1`), one or more calls to a licensed function that is only available in licensed editions of Chocolatey, is being used.

## Recommended Solution

Please do not use licensed features when creating packages that you will submit to the Chocolatey Community Repository. Update all automation scripts to use functions that are available in open-source Chocolatey.

## Reasoning

Packages created with licensed features should not be made available in the Chocolatey Community Repository and are intended for use by organizations hosting their own internal package repository.
All packages submitted to the Chocolatey Community Repository are for the community and should work on all editions of Chocolatey.
