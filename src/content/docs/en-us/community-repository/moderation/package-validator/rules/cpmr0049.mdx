## Issue

In the nuspec, there is a `<title />` element. It was found to be missing or empty in the package.

## Recommended Solution

Please update the nuspec to include a `<title />` element that is non-empty. If your nuspec file is missing this field, you should run `choco new testpkg` and look at the output from that (ensure you have the [latest version of Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages?q=id%3Achocolatey)).

## Reasoning

A title is a more description version of your package id - where your package id may be something like `jjb` - the title would be `Jenkins Job Builder`.
