## Issue

The package id includes dots and has not been found to be an `*.install`/`*.portable` package.

## Recommended Solution

If this is a new package that has never been approved, moderators will review and reject the package for one that will be pushed with a new id that meets the <Xref title="package naming guidelines" value="create-packages" anchor="naming-your-package" />.

If this is an already existing package, there is really nothing you can do at this time aside from deprecate the current package in favor of a newly created one. Please see <Xref title="deprecating a package" value="deprecate-a-package" />

## Reasoning

Naming should be consistent for packages on the community feed so it's easy to understand.
