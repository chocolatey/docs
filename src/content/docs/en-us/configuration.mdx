There are settings and features that can customize the way that Chocolatey works for you. The following is a list of config settings and features and their default values.

<Callout type="info">
    When a Chocolatey configuration or feature is removed (for example, it becomes deprecated and no longer required), it will not be removed from the chocolatey.config file automatically when you upgrade Chocolatey.
    This is in order to preserve backwards compatibility, should the user decide to go back to a previous version of Chocolatey.
</Callout>

## Features

Features are adjusted using `choco feature enable|disable --name="'<nameFromBelow>'"`. For more information See Xref title="`choco feature` command" value="choco-command-feature" /> or run `choco feature -?`.

A checkbox means this feature is turned on by default.

### General

* [ ] `logWithoutColor` - Log without color - Do not show colorization in logging output.
* [ ] `logEnvironmentValues` - Log Environment Values - will log values of environment before and after install (could disclose sensitive data).
* [x] `showNonElevatedWarnings` - Show Non-Elevated Warnings - Display non-elevated warnings.
* [x] `showDownloadProgress` - Show Download Progress - Show download progress percentages in the CLI.
* [ ] `useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades` - Use Remembered Arguments For Upgrades - when running upgrades, use arguments for upgrade that were used for installation ('remembered'). This is helpful when running upgrade for all packages. This is considered in preview and will be flipped to on by default in a future release.
* [ ] `logValidationResultsOnWarnings` - Log validation results on warnings - Should the validation results be logged if there are warnings?

### Automatic Uninstaller

* [x] `autoUninstaller` - Uninstall from programs and features without requiring an explicit uninstall script.
* [ ] `failOnAutoUninstaller` - Fail if automatic uninstaller fails.

### Exit Codes

* [x] `usePackageExitCodes` - Use Package Exit Codes - Package scripts can provide exit codes. With this on, package exit codes will be what choco uses for exit when non-zero (this value can come from a dependency package). Chocolatey defines valid exit codes as 0, 1605, 1614, 1641, 3010. With this feature off, choco will exit with 0, 1, or -1 (matching previous behavior).
* [ ] `useEnhancedExitCodes` - Use Enhanced Exit Codes - Chocolatey is able to provide enhanced exit codes surrounding list, search, info, outdated and other commands that don't deal directly with package operations. To see enhanced exit codes and their meanings, please run `choco [cmdname] -?`. With this feature off, choco will exit with 0, 1, or -1  (matching previous behavior). Default off.
* [ ] `exitOnRebootDetected` - Exit On Reboot Detected - Stop running install, upgrade, or uninstall when a reboot request is detected. Requires 'usePackageExitCodes' feature to be turned on. Will exit with either 350 or 1604. When it exits with 350, it means pending reboot discovered prior to running operation. When it exits with 1604, it means some work completed prior to reboot request being detected.

### Flow Control

* [x] `ignoreInvalidOptionsSwitches` - Ignore Invalid Options/Switches - If a switch or option is passed that is not recognized, should choco fail?
* [ ] `failOnStandardError` - Fail if install provider writes to stderr. Not recommended for use.
* [ ] `stopOnFirstPackageFailure` - Stop On First Package Failure - stop running install, upgrade or uninstall on first package failure instead of continuing with others. As this will affect upgrade all, it is normally recommended to leave this off.
* [ ] `skipPackageUpgradesWhenNotInstalled` - Skip Packages Not Installed During Upgrade - if a package is not installed, do not install it during the upgrade process.
* [ ] `ignoreUnfoundPackagesOnUpgradeOutdated` - Ignore Unfound Packages On Upgrade Outdated - When checking outdated or upgrades, if a package is not found against sources specified, don't report the package at all.
* [x] `usePackageRepositoryOptimizations` - Turn on optimizations for reducing bandwidth with repository queries during package install/upgrade/outdated operations. Should generally be left enabled, unless a repository needs to support older methods of query. When disabled, this makes queries similar to the way they were done in Chocolatey v0.10.11 and before.

### Security

* [ ] `useFipsCompliantChecksums` - Use FIPS Compliant Checksums - Ensure checksumming done by choco uses FIPS compliant algorithms. Not recommended unless required by FIPS Mode. Enabling on an existing installation could have unintended consequences related to upgrades/uninstalls.
